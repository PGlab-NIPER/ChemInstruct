Selective P450BM3 Hydroxylation of Cyclobutylamine and Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamine Derivatives: Underpinning Synthetic Chemistry for Drug Discovery,title,"P450BM3, Cyclobutylamine, Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamine"
"Achieving single-step syntheses of a set of related compounds divergently and selectively from a common starting material affords substantial efficiency gains when compared with preparing those same compounds by multiple individual syntheses. In order for this approach to be realized, complementary reagent systems must be available; here, a panel of engineered P450BM3 enzymes is shown to fulfill this remit in the selective C–H hydroxylation of cyclobutylamine derivatives at chemically unactivated sites. The oxidations can proceed with high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, producing valuable bifunctional intermediates for synthesis and applications in fragment-based drug discovery. The process also applies to bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP) amine derivatives to achieve the first direct enantioselective functionalization of the bridging methylenes and open a short and efficient route to chiral BCP bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. The combination of substrate, enzyme, and reaction engineering provides a powerful general platform for small-molecule elaboration and diversification.",abstract,"P450BM3, Cyclobutylamine, Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamine (BCP) amine"
"Cyclobutyl amino alcohols are versatile synthetic intermediates whose derivatives feature in medicinal chemistry as key components in pharmaceutical candidates, (1) as motifs for exploring QSAR models and in lead/fragment-based drug discovery, (2) and as sp3-rich bioisosteric replacements for their aryl counterparts. (3) Despite this, there are few general methods for producing such compounds, particularly in an enantiomerically enriched form. Usually, each ring size and regio- or stereoisomer requires its own bespoke synthetic route. Representative multistep sequences leading to cis-3-hydroxy-cyclobutylamine (CBA) derivatives 2 and the enantiomers of both cis- 4 and trans-2-hydroxy-CBA 6 are summarized in Figure 1A",introduction,"Cyclobutyl amino alcohols, cis-3-hydroxy-cyclobutylamine (CBA), cis-4-hydroxy-CBA, trans-2-hydroxy-CBA"
"Bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamine (BCPA), a more globular CBA rigidified by virtue of an additional 1,3-methano bridge, presents defined potential exit vectors extending three-dimensionally. (8) BCPA itself is incorporated into pharmaceutical candidates as an aniline bioisostere, and the readily accessible 3-substituted BCPAs act as bioisosteric replacements for para-substituted aniline linkages (e.g., 7, Figure 1B). (9) Chiral 3-substituted BCPAs have been prepared in enantioenriched form, but in these the BCP core is stereochemically inert, offering little beyond conformational rigidity and functional group separation. (10) The 2-disubstituted BCPAs are far more compelling since they are inherently chiral and, as potential bioisosteres for ortho- and meta-substituted anilines, are desirable targets; however, their synthesis is challenging, particularly in enantioenriched form. (11) This challenge has been met in part by the groups of Ma (12) and Baran (13) building on strain-release amination concepts (8 ? 9, Figure 1C). (14) The approach reported by Qin’s group, comprising the cyclization of sulfonyl hydrazones, (15) the multistep route from Mykhailiuk’s group, (16) and the elaboration of 2-bromo-BCP-1-carboxylic acid derivatives from MacMillan’s group (17) all have potential in this context.
While impressive, these high-profile recent advances in CBA and BCPA chemistry have not yet led to a unified synthetic strategy that delivers access to all positions around these cores. Such a strategy would be extremely valuable to both academia and industry, and this report describes developments toward a solution based on selective P450BM3-biocatalytic hydroxylation of CBA and BCPA cores (Figure 1D). The approach achieves structural and functional small-molecule diversification via unique oxidized metabolites which connect with the vast chemistry of the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, circumventing the requirement for tailored syntheses of specific target compounds.",introduction,"Bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-ylamine (BCPA), CBA, 3-substituted BCPAs, 2-disubstituted BCPAs, 2-bromo-BCP-1-carboxylic acid, P450BM3"
"Herein, we highlight the capacity of a P450BM3 library to catalyze selective hydroxylation of CBA and BCPA cores via a progressive screening approach, without the need for multiple rounds of mutagenesis and rescreening, testing the extent to which, collectively, these enzymes may be considered off-the-shelf reagents for selective C–H oxidation. The enzyme library evolved from four parent mutants of the P450BM3 wild-type, through studies on the oxidation of a variety of substrate classes as described in earlier publications. (18) Substrates were screened against the same 48-member subset of the wider library (with minor variations, see Supporting Information section S2), selected on the basis of reactivity profiles established in previous work with substrates of similar molecular weights and structural motifs, including anilides, cyclic amines, and cycloalkanes. (19)
In selected cases, focused second-generation panels were constructed from existing variants within the full library based on the metabolite profiles of the initial 48-variant library, and these were subsequently screened against substrates to explore further improvements in selectivity.",introduction,"P450BM3, CBA, BCPA, anilides, cyclic amines, cycloalkanes"
"Initial analytical screens were conducted for substrate conversion and product selectivity, as judged by gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of the crude organic extract from reactions in 24-well plates. Promising reactions were scaled up sufficiently for NMR characterization of the metabolites and for analytical assays to be established. Free amines are not well tolerated in P450BM3 reactions; therefore, the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) derivative 12a of cyclobutylamine (Figure 1D) was chosen for initial screening. The Boc group imparts a steric and electronic basis for achieving orientation and binding within the active site and is easy to remove when it is no longer required. The main focus of the study remained with Boc-CBA but further N-substituted analogues were screened for comparison.",result and discussion,"P450BM3, tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), cyclobutylamine, Boc-CBA
"
"The wild-type (WT) P450BM3 showed no conversion in the initial screen, but 36 of the variants converted at least 30% of substrate 12a to products within 24 h. All four 2- and 3-monohydroxylated metabolites were observed (Figure 2), of which the trans-2- and trans-3-hydroxylated products 14 and 15, respectively, dominated in most cases. The cis-1,2 isomer 16 was the major product for just one of the significantly converting enzymes (RK/AL) although this metabolite was produced more efficiently with KU3/AP/SW despite isomer 14 being the major product with this variant. The cis-1,3 isomer 17 was not found as the major product during the screen; the most favorable outcome was with GQ/IG/AL which achieved 33% 17 and 49% 15 at 91% conversion. Minor unidentified metabolites comprised no more than ?15% of the product mixtures for the high-converting (?70%) variants. Any ?-oxidation product is expected to degrade to cyclobutanone by eliminating tert-butyl carbamate and was not observed. The screening program revealed that, collectively, the 48-enzyme subset exhibited a roughly 7:1 preference for hydroxylation trans to the NHBoc substituent, with a slight preference for 2- over 3-hydroxylation.",result and discussion,"P450BM3, cyclobutanone, tert-butyl carbamate"
"With access to the less-favored cis-hydroxylated metabolites in mind, and as a simple alternative to conducting rounds of mutagenesis, the N-substituent was varied in a substrate engineering approach. (20) The p-toluenesulfonyl (Ts) analogue 12b was also well tolerated by the screening panel, with 31 variants achieving at least 30% conversion of the substrate. Only trans-1,3 18 and cis-1,2 21 cyclobutane hydroxylation products were identified, although p-toluenesulfonamide was observed in the GC traces, comprising up to almost 30% of the metabolite integration, consistent with production of the unstable 1-hydroxylation product 20. 3-Hydroxylation dominated, with 2-hydroxylation occurring to a comparable extent in just two cases. The methyl substituent in the Ts group was susceptible toward hydroxylation, and the derived benzyl alcohol 19 was observed in many screening reactions, accounting for up to 68% of the metabolite mixture and being the second most abundant metabolite overall.",result and discussion,"p-toluenesulfonyl, trans-1,3 cyclobutane, cis-1,2 cyclobutane, p-toluenesulfonamide, benzyl alcohol"
"The isopropanesulfonyl (Ips) derivative 12c showed limited reactivity toward the screening panel with only three variants converting at least 30% of the substrate. Variant KU3/AP/SW gave 91% conversion to all four monohydroxylated products, with the cis-1,2 isomer 22 being the major product; notably, this enzyme had also been the most productive for cis-1,2 metabolites 16 and 21 from substrates 12a and 12b, respectively.
From this initial screening round, changes in the N-substituent were sufficient to favor different major hydroxylated CBA isomers: trans-1,2 from 12a, trans-1,3 from 12b, and cis-1,2 from 12c. The most productive and selective combinations of N-substituent and enzyme variant for each isomer are summarized in Table 1.",result and discussion,"Isopropanesulfonyl (Ips), cis-1,2 isomer"
"The chiral trans-1,2 metabolite 14 was chosen as an exemplar for optimization, aiming to maximize the enantioselectivity on a synthetically meaningful scale. To begin, variant RP/HL/IG was selected from the highest-converting enzymes in the initial screen because it was the most selective for 14, it gave the product in 98% ee, and there was an existing panel available of 41 further enzyme variants derived from this starting point. From these second-generation variants, the L437 insertion mutants were found to be the most effective in terms of conversion and selectivity for the production of metabolite 14. Of these, the RG/LLV variant was more readily expressed in E. coli and showed excellent scaleability, with the TTN exceeding 5000 at a substrate/enzyme ratio of 20?000:1 (substrate concentration = 10 mM/1.7 g L–1). For preparative scale reactions, a higher substrate concentration achieved a more manageable reaction volume but at the expense of conversion; however, oxygenation of the reaction mixture restored much of the original reactivity. Thus, when either air or oxygen were bubbled through reaction mixtures containing 1.0 mmol of substrate 12a, conversion progressed approximately four times (air) to six times (oxygen) further during the first six hours of reaction; after this time, the conversions began to plateau, leading to a roughly 2.5-fold (air) and 3.5-fold (oxygen) relative progression at 12 h [see section S5.3.1].",result and discussion,oxygen
"Under these conditions, a 3.42 g (20 mmol) scale reaction (2.0 L) reached 85% conversion at 40 h leading to a 48% isolated yield of (1S,2S)-14 (>99% ee), the absolute configuration here being established by correlation with the single crystal X-ray structure of the product from a reaction with the RP/HL/IG/AI variant. From a separate reaction (1.0 mmol of 12a), sufficient of the minor cis-1,2 metabolite 16 (93% ee) was obtained to allow assignment of its absolute configuration as (1R,2S)- by chemical correlation [see section S5.5]. Repeated screening reactions of substrate 12a with selected mutants established the reproducibility of the hydroxylation. With five representative enzymes, the absolute values of the conversion, selectivity, and ee varied by ?1–5%, ?1–8%, and <1%, respectively [see section S3.3].
For 12b, second-round screening using a sublibrary of variants designed to increase the steric demand of active site residues by including larger amino acids such as tryptophan, showed variants RT2/FW and RT2/AW to be particularly reactive and selective for the trans-1,3 metabolite 18 with few other side-products generated. Reactions with RT2/AW scaled up more successfully, and from 0.1 to 0.6 mmol of substrate 12b, product 18 was isolated in 46–65% yield. From these reactions, a sample of the minor cis-1,2 metabolite 21 was obtained, assigned as (1S,2R)- from the single crystal diffraction study, complementary to (1R,2S)-16 obtained from 12a.
Substrate 12c was sufficiently soluble in the aqueous buffer used in the hydroxylation reactions that an organic cosolvent was unnecessary, and this allowed the detrimental effect of typical cosolvents on reactivity to be highlighted. With variant KU3/AP/SW, conversion of substrate 12c (0.1 mmol) after 48 h was approximately two to three times higher with 12c added neat than when the substrate was added as a solution in DMSO or ethanol [see section S5.3.2]. With this modification, a preparative-scale reaction showed 88% selectivity for the 2-position and the cis 22 and trans 23 isomers were isolated in 22% and 26% yield, respectively. The assigned (1S,2R)- absolute configuration of the cis isomer 22 was supported by Mosher’s ester analysis [see section S6.4]. The improved efficiency of this reaction enabled the minor 3-hydroxylated metabolites to be isolated as an unseparated mixture of the cis 24 and trans 25 isomers (8.5%, 60:40 ratio).
Turning to the BCPA series, of the two potential oxidation sites in the BCP ring the high strength of the bridgehead methine C–H bond (BDE ?110 kcal mol–1) (21) likely precludes biocatalytic hydroxylation at that site; accordingly, interest focused on achieving enantioselective hydroxylation of one of the methylene bridging groups. N-Boc BCPA 13a showed modest reactivity during screening, with the most efficient variant GV/AI achieving 58% conversion, of which 69% was the desired 2-hydroxylation product 26 (Figure 3), with 66% ee in favor of the (2R)-enantiomer. The reaction scaled well to produce (2R)-26 in 44% isolated yield from 1.5 mmol of substrate 13a and recrystallization led to a sample in >99% ee from which the absolute configuration was established from single crystal X-ray diffraction studies [see sections S6.5 and S8]. Just 10 of the other enzyme variants gave 20% or greater conversion, in each case affording 26 with enantiomeric excess ranging from 77% (2R)- to 47% (2S)- although higher values (up to 82%-R and 58%-S) were found for some of the less reactive enzyme variants. In this substrate, oxidation of the Boc group was observed, giving hydroxymethyl compound 27 and cyclic hemiaminal 28 [crystallographic data, section S8], usually as minor products in about a quarter of the variants.",result and discussion,"amino acids, tryptophan, DMSO, ethanol, N-Boc BCPA,  methine, methylene, cyclic hemiaminal"
"The screening panel had captured a wide range of reactivity and enantioselectivity, and preliminary attempts to improve these parameters by rational mutagenesis around key residues (data not shown) were not productive. The tert-butyl substituent of the Boc group is roughly isosteric with the BCP core; therefore, the termini of substrate 13a are poorly differentiated and additionally may limit access of the central heteroatom functionality to the active site residues, both factors likely to negatively impact conversion and selectivity. In view of this, the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) analogue 13d was screened, and this was found to be significantly more active than 13a, with 20 of the enzyme variants achieving at least 80% conversion to products. The 2-hydroxylation product 29 dominated over all other identifiable metabolites for over one-third of the enzymes and enantiomeric excesses >90% were achieved in nine cases. The major enantiomer of this metabolite was in the same series throughout, shown to be 2R- by comparison of its chiral GC data with a sample prepared from (2R)-26 by Boc deprotection and formation of the Cbz derivative [see section S5.5]. No correlation of the ee values for 26 and 29 with the enzyme variants could be discerned across the two series; for example, variants that delivered 29 in ?90% or greater ee gave ees for 26 ranging from ?50 to +50%, and those giving racemic 29 gave 26 in ees up to 82%. The hydroxylation with variant K19/FV/QP was scaled up to prepare 74 mg of alcohol 29 from 1.4 mmol of substrate 13d [39% based on recovered 13d (42%)] from which side-products were observed by NMR spectroscopy that had not been discernible using the GC parameters employed during screening. These included benzyl carbamate and (2-hydroxymethyl)phenol, the latter likely arising from sequential aryl and benzylic hydroxylation and then reduction of the so-formed salicylaldehyde.",result and discussion,"Benzyl carbamate, (2-hydroxymethyl)phenol, Salicylaldehyde, benzyloxycarbonyl"
"Direct hydroxylation of CBA and BCPA cores provides difunctionalized templates from which selective transformations of either the protected amine or the free alcohol functionality can lead rapidly to diverse small-molecule collections. (22) As summarized in Scheme 1, the newly introduced hydroxyl group in (1S,2S)-14 is compatible with removal of the Boc group and N-acylation to give, in this case, a substrate 30 for potential elaboration by cross-coupling chemistry. Conversely, the NHBoc substituent is compatible with oxidation to ketone 31, under conditions that result in minimal loss of enantiopurity (98% ee). Selective O-functionalization is illustrated for both (1S,2S)-14 and 18 in two medicinal-chemistry relevant applications. First, the 2-aminocyclobutyl ester derivative 32 of probenecid, an antihyperuricemic drug, was obtained by Steglich esterification. Second, the 5-bromo regioisomer 33 of a key intermediate in Amgen’s synthesis of candidate PDE10 inhibitors was prepared by SNAr reaction as a single diastereomer; this compares favorably with the published route, which starts with the considerably more expensive 3-oxocyclobutane carboxylic acid and gives a mixture of diastereomers of the 3-bromo regioisomer in 5% overall yield. (23)",result and discussion,"amine, alcohol, 2-aminocyclobutyl ester, probenecid, 3-oxocyclobutane carboxylic acid "
"In combination with varying the N-substituent, the chosen enzymes, representing ?10% of the larger enzyme library, achieved selective hydroxylation at the 2- and 3-positions in CBA with all diastereomers being accessible. In the absence of targeted mutagenesis campaigns, almost quantitative substrate conversion and 70–80% selectivity were achieved for the trans diastereomers, and high enantioselectivity was found for the 1,2-regioisomers. With BCPA carbamates, reliable hydroxylation at the bridging methylenes generated products in both enantiomeric series with ee values spanning the range ?58% [(2S)-26] to >99% [(2R)-29]. Accordingly, this study confirms that when combined with trivial substrate modifications, a highly focused subset of the existing P450BM3 library can achieve strategic C–H hydroxylation to provide high value chiral product molecules. The selectivity of high-performing variants for each product can be enhanced by combining impactful mutations from screening and site-saturation mutagenesis. In principle, further screening could identify variants capable of transforming the first-round metabolites and derivatives leading to trisubstituted small ring amines.",conclusion,"enzyme, CBA, BCPA carbamates, methylenes, P450BM3, amines"

Total Synthesis of (+)-Euphorikanin A via an Atropospecific Cascade,title,(+)-Euphorikanin A 
"A total synthesis of the ingenane-derived diterpenoid (+)-euphorikanin A is described. Key to the strategy is a stereocontrolled one-pot sequence consisting of transannular aldol addition reaction, hemiketal formation, and subsequent semipinacol rearrangement that efficiently leads to the complete euphorikanin skeleton. Atroposelective ring-closing olefin metathesis proved critical for the stereospecific cascade, leading to formation of a (Z)-bicyclo[7.4.1]tetradecenone core. An additional salient feature of the route is pyrolysis of a bis-methylxanthate to cleanly furnish the natural product.",abstract,"diterpenoid (+)-euphorikanin A, hemiketal, euphorikanin, olefin, (Z)-bicyclo[7.4.1]tetradecenone, bis-methylxanthate"
"The Euphorbiaceae plant family produces a range of bioactive natural products, most notably the ingenane diterpenoids, (1?4) which have been the subject of extensive synthetic studies for decades. (5) Isolated in 2016 by Zhang and co-workers from Euphorbia kansui, (+)-euphorikanin A (1) (Scheme 1) has been proposed to be a rearranged ingenane. (6) The intriguing 5/6/7/3-fused tetracyclic skeleton in combination with the [3.2.1]-bridging ?-lactone renders (+)-euphorikanin A (1) a significant synthetic challenge. (7) To date, two total syntheses of 1 have been reported. The first proceeded in 19 steps from (+)-carene and featured a reductive annulation reaction that installed ring-A and ?-lactone in one step. (8) A second approach showcased a benzilic acid type rearrangement in the final step to access the ?-lactone in overall 30 steps from (+)-carene. (9) Common to both approaches is the assembly of the A and B rings in a sequential manner. We envisioned an alternative strategy in which the A and B rings along with the ?-lactone would be constructed from a functionalized 10-membered ring in a single operation. Herein we report a novel synthesis of (+)-euphorikanin A (1). At the heart of the approach is a sequence of transformations that includes the formation of bicyclo[7.4.1]tetradecene I via ring-closing metathesis (RCM) and a cascade from trione II to the euphorikanin skeleton IV. We showcase that the formation of atropisomeric bicyclic rings is influenced by the configuration of the acyclic chains in the RCM precursor. Conversion of II to IV proceeds in one pot through a sequence of reactions consisting of transannular aldol addition, formation of hemiketal III, and semipinacol rearrangement to afford the complete skeleton of euphorikanin A.

"In conclusion, we report a novel total synthesis of (+)-euphorikanin A (1) in 15 steps from (+)-3-carene. Ring-closing olefin metathesis leads to a (Z)-bicyclo[7.4.1]tetradecenone core, which exists as two possible atropisomers. A key observation from the study is that the configuration of the side chains influences atropisomer formation, which proved critical for the subsequent atropospecific cascade. The sequence consisted of transannular aldol addition reaction, hemiketal formation, and subsequent semipinacol rearrangement to efficiently furnish the complete skeleton of (+)-euphorikanin A (1). Strategically, the work more broadly demonstrates that fused, polycyclic frameworks can be prepared efficiently from medium-sized bicyclic systems. Importantly, the generation of atropisomerism may increase the complexity of an intermediate in the route, however, with the payoff that it can serve as an element of stereocontrol and facilitate transannular transformations",NA,"(+)-euphorikanin A , (+)-3-carene, (Z)-bicyclo[7.4.1]tetradecenone, hemiketal"
The Role of Surface Complexes in Ketene Formation from Fatty Acids via Pyrolysis over Silica: from Platform Molecules to Waste Biomass,title,"Ketene, Fatty Acids, Silica"
"Fatty acids (FA) are the main constituents of lipids and oil crop waste, considered to be a promising 2G biomass that can be converted into ketenes via catalytic pyrolysis. Ketenes are appraised as promising synthons for the pharmaceutical, polymer, and chemical industries. Progress in the thermal conversion of short- and long-chain fatty acids into ketenes requires a deep understanding of their interaction mechanisms with the nanoscale oxide catalysts. In this work, the interactions of fatty acids with silica are investigated using a wide range of experimental and computational techniques (TPD MS, DFT, FTIR, in situ IR, equilibrium adsorption, and thermogravimetry). The adsorption isotherms of linear and branched fatty acids C1–C6 on the silica surface from aqueous solution have been obtained. The relative quantities of different types of surface complexes, as well as kinetic parameters of their decomposition, were calculated. The formation of surface complexes with a coordination bond between the carbonyl oxygens and silicon atoms in the surface-active center, which becomes pentacoordinate, was confirmed by DFT calculations, in good agreement with the IR feature at ?1680 cm 1. Interestingly, ketenes release relate to these complexes’ decomposition as confirmed by the thermal evolution of the absorption band (1680 cm–1) synchronously with the TPD peak of the ketene molecular ion. The established regularities of the ketenezation are also observed for the silica-induced pyrolysis of glyceryl trimyristate and real waste, rapeseed meals.",abstract,"Fatty acids (FA), lipids, ketenes, oxide, silica, carbonyl oxygens, silicon atoms, glyceryl trimyristate"

"Ketenes are widely used in industrial chemistry.

(18,19) The traditional methods of ketene production, such as thermal pyrolysis of carboxylic acids and ketones, dehalogenation of ?-halo acyl halides, and dehydrohalogenation of acyl halides with tertiary amines in a solvent, are multistep processes with the utilization of hazardous reagents and solvents producing chlorinated byproducts. (20) Therefore, ketene production by the catalytic pyrolysis of carboxylic acids over silica is an environmentally benign alternative. (21) Thus, investigation of the catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of carboxylic acids over silica is essential for further developing oleochemical production methods.",introduction,"Ketenes, carboxylic acids, ketones, ?-halo acyl halides, acyl halides, tertiary amines, silica"
"Ketenes attract significant interest as synthons in organic synthesis due to their high reactivity and nucleophilicity. (17,22) Importantly, ketenes are considered privileged synthons in the syntheses of three-, four-, five-, and six-membered heterocycles. (23) They can be used to synthesize any organic acid derivatives and as acylating agents, (24) for example, in the catalytic acylation of anisole by acetic anhydride to yield p-methoxyacetophenone. (25,26) Ketenes are also used in pharmaceutical applications such as preparing ?-lactam antibiotics. ",introduction,"Ketenes, anisole, acetic anhydride, p-methoxyacetophenone"
"In addition, establishing the critical role of ketenes as an essential member of the highly reactive first-generation reaction intermediates such as carbocations, carbanions, radicals, and carbenes has been the target in a number of studies mainly during the last five years. (28?32) Their crucial role in processes of zeolite catalysis was identified as (1) syngas to light olefins over oxide–zeolite-based composites; (31) (2) methanol conversion to hydrocarbons; (29) (3) catalytic acylation of anisole by acetic anhydride to yield p-methoxyacetophenone; (25) (4) ketene transformation to gasoline; (30) (5) ketonization of aliphatic acids; (32) and (6) acid-catalyzed carbonylation over zeolites. (33) Chen and coauthors showed that ketenes are intermediates in the acid-catalyzed carbonylation over zeolites by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and the confinement effect enforced by the pores of zeolites significantly influences this reaction (via formation and stability of ketenes (33)). The role of ketenes was revealed as a critical intermediate and product in the pyrolysis processes of biomass and its model compounds, i.e., cinnamic acids.

"The usage of a variety of quantum-mechanical methods, including density functional theory (DFT) to model silica surfaces was discussed by Rimola et al. (36) The established patterns of catalytic pyrolysis can help to select conditions of the process, inorganic oxides, to obtain the desirable product in quantitative yields. In addition, establishing binding mechanisms with the surface is practical in method development solving urgent problems in biology and medicine. Indeed, the carboxyl group is the primary building block of practically all essential biomolecules (amino acids, peptides, proteins, lipids, etc.). Although many studies investigate carboxylic acid decomposition on the silica surface, adsorption mechanisms, and the surface intermediates, these brought to date no clear conclusion. The influence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions and hydrocarbon chain length on adsorption mechanisms could not be established as well as mechanisms of ketene formation on the silica surface and the influence of the structure of acids on them. Hence, an endeavor has been undertaken to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms governing chemical reactions involving carboxylic acids on the surface layer of silica materials. The objective is to ascertain the adsorption structures of the complexes formed and understand the underlying mechanisms in the interaction between substances containing a carboxyl group and active sites present on the silica surface.",introduction,"silica, oxides,carboxyl group, amino acids, peptides, proteins, lipids,hydrocarbon, ketene"

"A 100 mg portion of silica was immersed in an aqueous solution of suitable acid of the appropriate concentration (0.01–0.1 mol·L–1) at pH 3.2 ± 0.3 and stirred at room temperature for 24 h to achieve equilibrium.

"The density functional theory method (DFT) was used to identify the nature of the absorption bands in the IR spectra. DFT calculations were carried out using the B3LYP, wB97XD, and M062X functionals and the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The last two functionals include the dispersion correction of forces, which is especially important in the study of intermolecular interactions. All calculations were performed using the GAUSSIAN 09 software (version D.01). (40) Active centers of the silica surface on which the adsorption and further thermal transformations of valeric acid probably occur were selected within (41) the framework of the cluster approximation model. In this approximation, the broken chemical bonds at the silica active centers, directed into the volume of the solid, were closed by hydrogen atoms",Experimental Section,"valeric acid, hydrogen atoms"
"In addition, the silica surface itself was modeled using two different approaches. The first one is based on the “soft” surface model, in which the SiO4 fragments in the active center can move relatively easily relative to each other. In this case, the structural rigidity (the possibility of rearrangement) is determined mainly by the energies of hydrogen bonds and dispersive interactions. The second approach is the so-called “hard” surface model. The possibility of the active center reorganization is determined primarily by the deformation of Si–O–Si and O–Si–O valence angles and the change in the torsion angles between its fragments.

"Establishing the interaction between the silica surface and compounds containing a carboxyl group is of significant fundamental and applied importance. Ketenization reaction kinetics for a series of aliphatic acids on a silica surface was previously investigated using the linear free energy relationships (LFER) approach. (19) Kinetic parameters and reaction constants, ?0, were calculated for the reaction of ketene formation. Based on the data obtained, an intramolecular mechanism of ketenization was proposed from an adsorbed carboxylate, which proceeds through a four-membered low-polarity transition state. However, the question regarding the adsorbed carboxylate remains open mainly because there is no sufficient spectroscopic confirmation of such species, e.g., the corresponding IR absorption bands. Despite surface siloxane bonds being nonactive, (19,38) silanol groups lead to carboxylates upon interaction with the acidic substrate leading to an absorption band ?C?O around 1680 cm–1 for adsorbed valeric acid. (15,21,42,43) An alternative adsorption mechanism was proposed resulting from a nucleophilic addition to siloxane bridges. (19,35) Zhuravlev (44) considers the formation of reactive siloxane bridges resulting from surface dehydration and dehydroxylation processes as confirmed in several simulation works. (45) These studies provide data on the participation of siloxane bridges in nucleophilic addition reactions, particularly with ammonia and some primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. (46) The data of TPD MS studies (19) indicate a more complex nature of the interaction of aliphatic acids with the silica surface. In particular, three stages of desorption and destruction of carboxylic acids from the surface indicate at least three surface forms of adsorption. Obviously, the silica surface cannot be described only by the ideal cristobalite structure with uniformly distributed silanols; i.e., the surface may present areas of unevenly distributed silanol groups and hydrophobic siloxane. The following IR spectroscopy adsorption data and computational simulations correlate the stages during the pyrolytic process to specific adsorption modes of carbolylic structures on silica surfaces, including forming donor–acceptor intermediate complexes between the carboxylic substrates and a penta-coordinated silicon atom",result and discussion,"silica, aliphatic acids, ketene, carboxylate, acidic, valeric acid, siloxane, ammonia, amines, carboxylic acids, silanol, siloxane, silicon atom"
"The carboxylic substrates’ adsorption data (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1) is well described by the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.9534–0.9897), leading to an L-shape for adsorption isotherms of linear acid isomers and an S-shape for branched-chain isomers. Values of equilibrium adsorption capacity (qmax), adsorption equilibrium constant (K), and Gibbs free energies (?G) were obtained from linear regression analysis of known Ce and q values (47,48) and are listed in Table 1. The equilibrium adsorption capacities, proportional to the concentration of free silanol groups on the fumed silica surface (0.6 mmol·g–1), expand between 0.2 and 0.5 mmol·g–1. The isotherm-derived Gibbs free energies for propanoic, butanoic, and pentanoic acids have very close values, indicating a low affinity between carboxylic acids to the silica surface.",result and discussion,"carboxylic, acids, silanol groups, silica, propanoic, butanoic, pentanoic acids, carboxylic acids, silica surface"
"Upon silica exposure to the carboxylic substrates, FT-IR spectra were investigated in order to determine the adsorption modes and the complexes’ structure. The observed vibration of the carboxylic ?C?O stretching in saturated fatty acids is more intense than in ketones, appearing in the 1725–1705 cm–1 range (Table 2). These are comparatively lower to isolated saturated aliphatic acids in inert solvents (1760 cm–1) due to the hydrogen bonds formed between carboxylic acid dimers. (49) No bands could be attributed to unassociated carbonyl groups, typical monomeric acids, on samples obtained by the impregnation method (0.2–0.5 mmol·g–1). The absence of any vibration bands at 1760 cm–1 suggests that carboxylic acid is not free but rather associated. Indeed, the intensity of stretching vibrations of isolated silanols at 3745 cm–1 decreased for all investigated acids, confirming the formation of hydrogen-bonded adsorbed complexes SC II (Scheme 1). The stretching band at 3745 cm–1 did not completely disappear (Figure 2), meaning that not all isolated silanols (?20%) participate in the formation of adsorption complexes with carboxylic acids. The dependence of surface coverage versus acid surface concentration was calculated from the band’s intensity for hexanoic and propanoic acids. Ca. 20% of silanols formed the surface complex even at high surface coverage.",result and discussion,"silica, fatty acids, ketones, hydrogen, carboxylic acid, carbonyl, silanols, hexanoic, propanoic acids"
"The IR of pentanoic acid on silica shows a relevant band at 1685 cm–1 corresponding to surface complexes SC IIIa,b and can be observed under various conditions: room temperature and atmospheric pressure and after evacuation in vacuum at 20, 60, and 100 °C (Figure 4). While the intensity of such band remains upon evacuation in a vacuum, the vibration related to physically adsorbed water at 1621–1631 cm–1 significantly decreases (although still observable under vacuum at 100 °C due to the hydroxyl groups on the surface). The vibrational band at 1621–1631 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum is attributed to the combined contributions of strongly bound water within voids and physically adsorbed water on the silica’s surface. While the band’s intensity remains upon evacuation in a vacuum due to the presence of strongly bound water within voids, the hydroxyl groups on the surface allow for the continued observation of the band related to physically adsorbed water, even at elevated temperatures under vacuum conditions.",result and discussion,"pentanoic acid, silica, hydroxyl"
"Monodentately bound complexes of fatty acids on the surface of silica are challenging to identify employing IR spectroscopy since their ?C?O absorption region at ?1680 cm–1 is overlapped with the ?C?O band (?1715–1730 cm–1) and the water ?(H–O–H) band at 1640 cm–1. However, the latest band significantly shifts toward low wavenumbers with increasing strength of interaction of water molecules with the surface. (51) In addition, silica overtones are known to be located at 1640, 1870, and 1960 cm–1. (52) Monodentate bound complexes of fatty acids were identified through vibrational analysis (?? = ?C?O – ?C–O) for several nanosized oxides. (15) For silica, ?? is 285 cm –1 and corresponds to monodentate complexes. (53) Based on this and to clarify the mechanisms of interaction of fatty acids with the silica surface, the thermal evolution of the absorption bands in the range of 1400–1900 cm–1 for pentanoic acid adsorbed from the gas phase was subsequently investigated. The sample heating temperature range was chosen based on our previous studies. Thermal transformations of pentanoic acid on the surface of silica end at ?450 °C (Figure 5) as TPD curves of molecular and fragment ions of propylketene show that the desorption of propylketene drops to zero at ?450 °C. (15,19) At this temperature, the absorption disappears in the region corresponding to ?C–O and deformation vibrations ?C–H of CH2 and CH3 groups. This result is consistent with the TPD MS data and confirms the absence of any pentanoic acid on the silica surface at temperatures above 450 °C.",result and discussion,"fatty acids, silica, oxides, pentanoic acid, propylketene CH2, CH3"
"The investigation of pentanoic acid on silica revealed the presence of two distinct forms of water: strongly bound water, which is associated with adsorption complexes, and weakly bound water. Notably, the behavior of water desorption during the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) process is different, with a significant decrease in the intensity of water desorption observed specifically at the temperature of ketene desorption (?360 °C). The bands at ?1636 (?H–O–H) and ?1860 cm–1 (silica overtone) are often used to provide a semiquantitative elucidation of adsorbed water content in the surface layer. (54) However, they overlap, making an accurate measurement of their areas challenging, Figure 7. From the similar intensities of these bands, one can suggest approximately the same amount of each form. The intensity ratio of these two bands decreased with increasing temperature until 200 °C, Figure 7. At this temperature, it reaches a plateau, and at 450 °C, it gets a value of ?0.6, which is consistent with literature data for silica materials. Costa et al. (54) showed that the ratio between the areas of the 1636 and 1860 cm–1 bands does not reach zero because the absorbance area at the 1636 cm–1 band includes an overtone of silica at ?1640 cm–1.",result and discussion,"pentanoic acid, silica , ketene"
"Table 3 shows the wavenumbers related to the normal vibrational modes of adsorbed complexes on silica. During analysis of the simulated results, special attention was dedicated to identifying the carboxyl group vibrations of valeric acid and its anion (Figure 8). We measured the shift of wavenumbers characteristic of the different surface complexes and associated them with the structural rigidity of the selected models and interacting atoms.",result and discussion,"silica, carboxyl, valeric acid"
"The band at 1680 cm–1 was assigned to the vibrations of the dissociated carboxyl group, as the simulated IR bands agree with the experiments. The band corresponds to the bond between the carboxyl oxygen and the surface silicon atom, which becomes pentacoordinate (Figure 9). As the data in Table 3 show, this obtained result does not depend on the “soft” or “hard” model of the silica surface. However, it is determined only by the reactivity of the pentanoic acid molecule itself and the coordination capabilities of the silicon atoms on the surface. The formation of such a surface complex was also shown by Abdallah and coauthors. (55) Additionally, the existence of two types of water in the IR spectra until the complete conversion of acid into ketene provides additional evidence of the bonding of acids with strained siloxane bridges.",result and discussion,"carboxyl group, silicon atom, pentanoic acid, ketene, siloxane"
"Analysis of Etot values (Table 3) for all structures shown in Figure 8 allowed us to conclude that for structures of the A1–A10 group; the energetically most favorable structures are those in which pentanoic acid or its anion binds to the silica cluster through hydroxyl groups. The situation is different for the “hard” surface model, structures B1–B7. The difference is that in the case of an anion of an acid, this form of adsorption becomes energetically more favorable (Figure 8, structure B5), when the carboxyl group directly interacts with one of the silicon atoms of the surface. With this type of interaction, silicon becomes penta-coordinated. For example, for the M062X functional, the B5 structure is 5.02 kcal·mol–1 (preferable to B3 where intermolecular bonding occurs due to hydrogen bonds).",result and discussion,"pentanoic acid, silica, hydroxyl, acid, silicon"
"Figure 9 shows a summary of basic geometric parameters for all surface complexes where penta-coordinated silicon is formed. The magnitudes of the orders of coordination bonds between the oxygen of the carboxyl group and the corresponding silicon on the silica surface are also indicated. Such values of bond orders unambiguously confirmed the formation of penta-coordinated silicon.

"This highly relevant result confirmed the hypothesis of the formation of penta-coordinated silicon, with additional DFT studies carried out for the extended model of the “hard” surface. Based on the extended model of the “hard” surface, the results on the formation of pentacoordinate silicon as a result of the adsorption of pentanoic acid anion on the structures of group B were fully confirmed. In addition, the lengths of the coordination bond between the oxygen of the carboxyl group and the surface silicon became significantly smaller (Figure 9) and the values of the bond orders became larger. These results further support the fact that the extension of the surface model led to even more favorable complexes with penta-coordinated silicon. Here it is appropriate to emphasize once again that only structures with penta-coordinated silicon can explain the presence of a band in the region of 1680 cm–1 in the experimental IR spectra of pentanoic acid adsorption.",result and discussion,"silicon, oxygen, carboxyl, pentanoic acid"
"The high-temperature peak III was observed on TPD-MS curves for ions of hexadecyl ketene with m/z 42, 55, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112, and 126 (Figure 10). These peaks describe the formation of ketenes upon desorption of octadecanoic acid fragments. It is known that the most intensive ion in the electron impact ionization (electron bombardment ionization, formerly known as electron impact) mass spectra of ketenes is the ion with m/z 55 [H2C?C?C?O–H]+. (57) Peaks related to the destruction of chemisorbed fragment of acids with formation of ketenes [CH3(CH2)n–(H)C?C?O]+ (for ethanoic acid CH2?C?O) where n = 0–3; 15 occur on the TPD curve of all saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids. The intensity of ions for this homologous series decreases with increasing molecular mass. An increase in hydrophobicity led to the formation of more surface complexes, and more ketenes developed. This result indicates that the pyrolysis pattern of low molecular weight aliphatic carboxylic acids on the silica surface is also typical for heavier acids. Therefore, this reaction seems to be universal and can be used to process plant raw materials, producing oleochemicals and bulk chemicals for organic synthesis.",result and discussion,"hexadecyl ketene, ketenes, octadecanoic acid, ethanoic acid, carboxylic acids, silica"
"Furthermore, data from earlier studies demonstrated that during pyrolysis of carboxylic acids on silica within a homologous series, a direct correlation is present between the maximum acid decomposition temperature with ketene release, and both length and branching of the acid chain. (19,43,58) Specifically, a longer and more branched acid chain corresponds to a higher decomposition temperature. Interestingly, if such a trend is not exclusive to carboxylic acids, this could imply a possibility to extend such patterns to biomass/waste pyrolysis, particularly those with significant triglyceride fatty acid content. However, it is pertinent to note that Libby et al.'s study did not determine a relationship between chain length and activation energy required for ketene evolution.",result and discussion,"carboxylic acids, silica, ketene, acid, triglyceride fatty acid"
"The ratio between peak intensities increases in homologous series, although uncorrelated with the substate’s acidity, since the pKa remains practically constant over the entire range of compounds studied (Table 3). A shift of the ?C?O absorbance band of more than 60 cm–1 to the low-frequency region takes place as compared to that of the monomer (?C?O = 1757 cm–1), and a low perturbation degree of free surface silanols (surface coverage ? ? 0.2) testifies favorably to the formation of the surface-adsorbed complex bonded with a bond stronger than hydrogen. Such additional evidence confirms that the acid adsorption on silica occurs via forming a donor–acceptor complex, i.e., n-electrons of the carbonyl’s oxygen bonds with empty Si d-orbitals, which is more favorable with increasing the aliphatic chain length (62) because this increasing chain length results in increasing electron density on the oxygen atom of the C?O bond. Considering the increase in hydrophobicity, it is observed that the intensity of the ketene peak, observed based on octadecanoic acid, also increases. This correlation suggests that the number of complexes formed on the surface increases with an increase in hydrophobicity. Therefore, the intensity of the ketene peak can serve as an indicator of the enhanced formation of complexes, which is directly related to the hydrophobicity of the system. Probably, it could be associated with complexes formation with the parallel orientation to the surface like on Scheme 1, surface complexes SC IIIa and SC IIIb, because, in this case, the hydrophobicity has a significant impact on the complex stability and, as a result, on their preferable formation on the surface",result and discussion,"silanols, hydrogen, silica, oxygen, ketene, octadecanoic acid"
"The ratio of TPD-peak intensities (decomposition of adsorpted complex to destruction of hydrogen-bonded complex) is linked with the substrate’s hydrophobicity parameter, lgKow, a quantitative measure of the compound’s distribution between aqueous and organic phases from literature data (Table 4). Values of lgKow can be calculated using an additive (atom and group contributions) method, i.e., a molecule is dissected into primary fragments (functional groups or atoms) in which lgKow is known. (60) Basically, the higher the compound’s hydrophobicity, the more positive value of lgKow is. (60,61) Calculations of lgKow values for 2-methyl-propanoic and 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acids were carried out using Hansch and Leo’s compilation (additive method).

A significant variation is found between ethanoic and octadecanoic acids, which have a chain length difference of 16 CH2 groups. In a homologous series of carboxylic acids, the amount of acid chemisorbed on the silica surface increases with increasing hydrocarbon chain length; the total amount of chemisorbed acids is formed by 70% octadecanoic acid, 13% butanoic acid, and 14% ethanoic acid.",result and discussion,"ethanoic, butanoic, octadecanoic acids, butanoic acid, ethanoic acid."
"In order to confirm that results for fatty acids could be extended for waste biomass (and can be applied to 2G biomass conversion processes), additional studies of the pyrolysis kinetics of trimyristin and rapeseed meal over silica were subsequently conducted.
A set of ions characteristic of ketene myristic acid, dodecyl ketene, is observed in the mass spectra of volatile pyrolysis products of glycerol myristic (tetradecanoic) acid over silica at temperatures above 250°C (Figure 13A,B). The most intense ion in the mass spectra of ketenes is [H2C?C?C?O–H]+ with m/z 55 and a set of ions with the general formula [H(CH2)n–(H)C?C?O]+, which was observed for ketenes synthesized by catalytic pyrolysis from the homologous series of C1···C10 acids. (19,57) In the case of trimyristin, a set of ions with n = 0···10 is observed: m/z 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112, 126, 140, etc., Figure13A,B. At the same time, as the mass of the ion increases, its intensity decreases significantly, especially after m/z 98, and the molecular ion for long-chain ketenes, as a rule, is not observed, for example, for octyl ketene during pyrolysis of decanoic acid. (19,57,63) A peak is observed at Tmax ? 350°C on the TPD curves for these ions. That is, the temperature of the maximum desorption rate and, accordingly, the activation energy of dodecylketene formation (Tmax = 355°C, E?average = 110 kJ·mol–1) is lower than that of hexadecylketene (Tmax = 380°C, E?average = 114.4 kJ·mol–1) in the case of pyrolysis of octadecanoic (stearic) acid (Figure 10, Table 5). This probably indicates that ketene formation occurs due to the transformation of the surface complex of free myristic acid, which is not connected by an ester bond with glycerol (silica is known to effectively hydrolyze ester bonds)",result and discussion,"fatty acids, trimyristin, rapeseed, ketene, myristic acid, dodecyl ketene, glycerol myristic (tetradecanoic) acid, silica, ketenes, dodecylketene, hexadecylketene, octadecanoic (stearic) acid, ketene, glycerol, silica, ester"
"The hydrolysis of dicarboxylic esters, including long-chained aliphatic carboxylic acids with high selectivity and yield at temperatures ?220°C, was carried out by Dyker. (64) Undoubtedly, trimyristin is also hydrolyzed on the surface of silica when heated to ?200°C. As we can see (Figure 13B), low intensity peaks on the TPD curves for ions characteristic of free fatty acids, especially for the most intense ion [H2C?C(OH)2]+ with m/z 60 (65) at a temperature around 100°C, are observed. That indicates the absence of physisorbed and H-bonded forms of the acid (surface complexes I and II, Scheme 1), which were observed for the short-chain and long-chain acids, such as octadecanoic (stearic) (Figures 10 and 12, Table 5). So, hydrolysis mainly occurs during heating, which is absent when triglyceride is loaded on the silica surface. Therefore, triglyceride hydrolysis occurs during heating, forming a surface complex of myristic acid, which is then subjected to ketenization (Scheme 2).",result and discussion,"dicarboxylic esters, carboxylic acids, silica, fatty acids, acid, octadecanoic (stearic), triglyceride, silica, triglyceride, myristic acid"
"Some publications report on the processes of formation of short-chain fatty acids and some unsaturated aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbon due to C–C bond cleavage during fast pyrolysis and thermal cracking of triglycerides. (66) However, higher pyrolysis temperatures (750 (30 s) and 450 °C (30 s)), higher heating rates of 800°C/min, cracking at high pressures up to 37 MPa, or various catalysts had to be employed. (66) In our case of pyrolysis on the silica surface, the main process is ketenization. We can monitor if the cracking of triglycerides with C–C bond cleavage and the formation of short-chain acids are evolving by the TPD curve of the most intense characteristic ion with m/z 60 in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids. From the analysis of the behavior of the TPD curve with m/z 60, these processes (if taking place at all) occur at higher temperatures (>400°C). Their contribution to the overall pyrolysis process is minimum since the intensity of the ion m/z 60 contributes with a small percentage as compared to the intensity of the ion with m/z 55, Figure 13B.",result and discussion,"triglycerides, carboxylic acids"
"Silica allowed us to avoid the additional stage of hydrolysis of esters in converting 2G biomass rich in triglycerides and lipids. This has a significant economic benefit to develop waste oil crop biomass pyrolysis technologies?especially biomass from rapeseed crops and soybeans, the two largest oil crops grown worldwide. (67) Rapeseed production reached 29 million tons in 2022. At the same time, the annual production of waste oil crop meal reached 71 million tons. (68) The rapeseed meal is the primary waste produced via oil pressing. Accordingly, this byproduct has a high triglyceride content. However, this type of biomass is different from lignocellulosic biomass, and therefore, for its effective processing, it requires establishing the patterns of pyrolysis of the main components, particularly fatty acids and triglycerides. The lipid content in rapeseed meals reaches 7–10%, while rapeseed seeds contain a high amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (around 90%) and low concentrations (6.5–8%) of saturated fatty acids. (69,70)",result and discussion,"esters, triglycerides, lipids, rapeseed, lignocellulosic,fatty acids, rapeseed meals "
"The kinetics of pyrolysis of canola meal depend mainly on its fatty acid composition, comprising ca. 60% (Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid (oleic acid) (C18:1), 10% (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid (linolenic acid) (C18:3), 24% (9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid (linoleic acid) (C18:3), 4% hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) (C16:0), 2% octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) (C18:0), 0.25% tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid) (C14:0), and others. (69) Since almost 95% of the oil consists of acids with a chain length of C18, they will determine the kinetics of canola meal pyrolysis. As can be seen, the temperature of the maximum desorption rate of octadecylketene during pyrolysis of octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) at C18 is about 380 °C, Figure 10, Table 5. That is, this temperature is slightly higher with respect to 370 °C (localization of peaks on TPD curves of the characteristic ions of ketenes with m/z 55, 70, 84, 98, and 112 during the pyrolysis of rapeseed cake, Figure 14, Table 5). This is quite natural since C16:0 palmitic acid, which in rapeseed oil reaches 6%, also contributes to the formation of these peaks on the TPD curves of ketene fragment ions and, as a result, shifts them to a lower temperature. Our previous work (19) showed that the temperature of the maximum rate of ketene desorption increases with an increase in the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the acid. Accordingly, the activation energy of the ketenization reaction on the silica surface increases, Figure 15, Table 5. This is precisely why an increase in activation energy is observed in the following order: trimyristat (Eaverage? = 110 kJ·mol–1) < rapeseed meal (Eaverage? = 112.5 kJ·mol–1) < stearic acid (Eaverage? = 114.4 kJ·mol–1), Table 5.",result and discussion,"fatty acid, (Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid (oleic acid), (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid (linolenic acid, (9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid (linoleic acid), hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) , octadecanoic acid (stearic acid), tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid), octadecylketene, palmitic acid, ketene, hydrocarbon, acid, silica, trimyristat, rapeseed meal, stearic acid"
"In addition, a “structure–reactivity” correlation was found between E? and Taft induction constants of substituents (E? = 109.6 – 13.457 ??*) for the ketenization reaction. On the other hand, in the case of the ketonization reaction over ceria for a homologous series of acids, a correlation between the activation energy and the Taft steric constants of the substituents (E? = 126,84 – 3.096 ?Es*) was revealed. (14) Tmax is the most sensitive characteristic of the effect of substituents on reaction kinetics. In addition, Tmax reproduced in TPD experiments very accurately; because of this, many approximate equations using Tmax were proposed to calculate approximate values of the activation energy, (19,39,71) the reaction parameter po, (19) and the kinetic isotope effect. (3,14) In the spectra of volatile products of rapeseed meal pyrolysis over silica, there are no ions larger than m/z 112 (Figure 14). This is related to the features of fragmentation and ion-molecular reactions of molecular ions of ketenes of unsaturated acids (C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3) under the action of electron impact in the ion source of the mass spectrometer. This feature is due to their structure, particularly double bonds in their molecules, Scheme 3. It is known (72) that the primary way of alkenes fragmentation under electron impact is C–C bond cleavage in the beta position to the double bond, with the formation of allylic fragments, stabilized due to resonance (Scheme 3). In the case of molecular ions of ketenes of unsaturated acids, the predominant channel of transformation of the molecular ion will be C7–C6 bond cleavage with the formation of fragment ion m/z 112 (Scheme 3). The patterns obtained for fatty acids, triglycerides, and rapeseed meal in this work are of practical importance and can be used in the future in the development of sustainable technologies for the conversion of 2G biomass with a high content of triglycerides in the processing of oils/fats production waste and related waste feedstocks",result and discussion,"acids, silica, ketenes, fatty acids, triglycerides, rapeseed meal"
"Thermogravimetric analyses of silica and silica-supported acids were performed by soaking them in CCl4 solutions. The peaks at Tmax = 62 and 100–200°C and a broader peak at the temperature range of 200–500°C were observed on the derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curve (Figure 16). The first peak is associated with desorption from the silica surface of the physically adsorbed solvent (CCl4) or carboxylic acid dimers. The second one in the temperature region Tmax = 100–200°C would be associated with the decomposition of the hydrogen-bonded acid on the silica surface. The third and fourth peaks are related to the desorption of products from the dehydration and dehydroxylation processes, which take place in the temperate region 200–500°C.",result and discussion,"silica, CCl4, carboxylic acid dimers, hydrogen"
"On previous TPD results, (19) the peak for complex II, Tmax, appears in the temperature region 120–150°C (ethanoic – Tmax = 127°C; butanoic – Tmax = 154 °C) and practically coincides with the peak attributed to complex II on DTG curves. In the same way, the decomposition of complexes III/IV on TPD curves in the temperature range 360–390 °C (62) agrees with the DTG peak (?390°C) regarding the decomposition of complex IV. Therefore, TPD and DTG indicate a few decomposition stages of adsorbed compounds. In contrast, the differences between these techniques are attributed to the presence of oxygen during DTG thermal decomposition.",result and discussion,"ethanoic, butanoic"
"The interaction of linear and branched aliphatic carboxylic acids C1–C6, C18, triglyceride, and rapeseed meal with the fumed silica surface has been studied. Isotherms and physicochemical parameters of short fatty acid C1–C6 adsorption from an aqueous medium were obtained. The formation of different adsorption modes was identified using in situ IR spectroscopy, FTIR, thermogravimetry, TPD-MS, and DFT calculations. The observed adsorption modes are dimers bonded with the surface via van der Waals, hydrogen-bonded complexes, and adsorbed complexes bonded on the surface via the C?O group; their relative abundance and decomposition activation energies were obtained. A correlation between the hydrophobicity parameter lgKo/w and TPD intensities ratio of peaks assigned to decomposing hydrogen-bonded and C?O bonded complexes for studied acids has been obtained. These results indicate the significant contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the binding of fatty acids with silica. Notably, the formation of surface complexes coordinating the carboxyl oxygen and the silicon atom of the surface leads to a penta-coordinated Si atom, as confirmed by DFT simulations using both “soft” and “hard” model of the silica surface. Moreover, it was strongly confirmed on expanded “hard” model calculations through significantly decreasing the bond length between the Si atom and the O atom of acid. Besides fatty acids, two types of surface water were observed in the IR-spectra (?(H–O–H) at ?1640 and ?1615 cm–1), which remained on the surface until all chemisorbed acids were converted into ketenes, indicating the bonding of acids with strained siloxane bridges. Most importantly, these insightful studies support the fact that the established features observed from the ketene formation reaction can also be in principle extended to higher aliphatic acids, triglycerides, and waste biomass. These can pave the way to the design of environmentally safe technologies to process renewable biomass, plant triglycerides, and waste feedstocks into high-value-added products, including fine chemicals and fuels.",conclusion,"aliphatic carboxylic acids, triglyceride, rapeseed, silica, hydrogen, acids, fatty acids, carboxyl oxygen, silicon atom, Si atom, O atom, ketenes, siloxane, aliphatic acids"
Switched “On” Transient Fluorescence Output from a Pulsed-Fuel Molecular Ratchet,title,na
"We report the synthesis and operation of a molecular energy ratchet that transports a crown ether from solution onto a thread, along the axle, over a fluorophore, and off the other end of the thread back into bulk solution, all in response to a single pulse of a chemical fuel (CCl3CO2H). The fluorophore is a pyrene residue whose fluorescence is normally prevented by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) to a nearby N-methyltriazolium group. However, crown ether binding to the N-methyltriazolium site inhibits the PET, switching on pyrene fluorescence under UV irradiation. Each pulse of fuel results in a single ratchet cycle of transient fluorescence (encompassing threading, transport to the N-methyltriazolium site, and then dethreading), with the onset of the fluorescent time period determined by the amount of fuel in each pulse and the end-point determined by the concentration of the reagents for the disulfide exchange reaction. The system provides a potential alternative signaling approach for artificial molecular machines that read symbols from sequence-encoded molecular tapes.",abstract,"CCl3CO2H, N-methyltriazolium, disulfide "
"Biology uses chemically fueled ratcheting (1?7) in numerous metabolic processes, (8) including molecular-level information processing (9?11) and transportation. (12) Chemically powered ratcheting also forms the basis of a number of artificial molecular motors, (13?21) pumps, (20,22?31) and dissipative materials. (2,3,32?37) A molecular energy ratchet (16,29,38?44) was recently reported (43) in which a crown ether (a “reading head” that responds to particular “symbols” encoded on a molecular tape) is pumped from solution onto a molecular strand by a pulse (16,29,45?53) of a chemical fuel. (5) Further fuel pulses transported the macrocycle along the tape before releasing it back to the bulk solution off the other end of the strand. During its directional transport the crown ether changes conformation according to the stereochemistry of binding sites (asymmetric substituted dibenzylammonium (dba-) and N-methyltriazolium (mt-) groups) encountered along the way. (43) This allowed the sequence of stereochemical information programed into the molecular tape (i.e., the order the different binding sites are reached by the directionally transported crown ether) to be read out as a string of digits in a nondestructive manner through a changing circular dichroism response (Figure 1A). (43)",introduction,"crown ether, dibenzylammonium (dba-), N-methyltriazolium (mt-)"
"However, in the first generation (43) tape-reading ratchet the N-methyltriazolium groups are achiral, so there is no stereochemistry for the crown ether to respond to at half of the tape binding sites. Here, we demonstrate a potential alternative output that could be used for artificial molecular machines that read information from molecular tapes: transient fluorescence",introduction,N-methyltriazolium
"A key concept underpinning the new system (Figure 1B) is that the fluorescence of a pyrene residue on the tape should only be “switched on” (55) when a threaded directionally transported crown ether binds to the N-methyltriazolium group adjacent to the fluorophore. Otherwise the pyrene fluorescence is quenched (56?65) by photoinduced electron transfer (PET). To explore the feasibility of such a signaling process, we designed a model with a single digit (“1”) encoded in the molecular tape, as shown in Figures 1B and 2.",introduction,N-methyltriazolium
"An energy ratchet switches between different potential energy surfaces to reverse the relative depths of pairs of energy minima and the relative heights of pairs of energy maxima (Figure 2B). (1,7) This inexorably leads to statistically dictated directional transport without the position of the substrate needing to affect the kinetics of transport. (1,7) In the model energy ratchet (Figure 2A), the molecular thread contains dibenzylamine (green)/dibenzylammonium (blue) and N-methyltriazolium (orange) binding sites for the crown ether. Bulky groups at each end restrict the passage of the ring onto and off of the thread. The bulky hydrazone group (yellow) is acid-labile but kinetically inert under basic conditions; the bulky disulfide (purple) is base-labile but kinetically inert at acidic pH. This enables back-and-forth switching of the pH to cause the crown ether to enter and leave the thread from opposite ends. The system completes one full operational cycle with a single pulse of trichloroacetic acid (CCl3CO2H), a “pulsed fuel” (16,29,43,45?53) that undergoes base-catalyzed decarboxylation, forming CO2 and CHCl3 as the only waste products.

"In the presence of Et3N, the pulse of CCl3CO2H synchronizes the state of the molecules in the system by first changing the environment to an acidic pH (temporarily converting the Et3N present to the ammonium carboxylate salt). (16,43) This promotes threading of the crown ether onto the protonated dibenzylammonium site past the labile hydrazone barrier. As the trichloroacetic acid decarboxylates, the pH of the solution becomes basic (the loss of acid liberating the Et3N originally present), and the ammonium group is deprotonated to an amine, which has a low affinity for crown ether binding.",introduction,"Et3N, CCl3CO2H, ammonium, crown ether, dibenzylammonium,hydrazone, trichloroacetic acid, amine"
"Consequently, the macrocycle quickly relocates to the N-methyltriazolium binding site (the local energy minimum) before slowly dethreading over the disulfide barrier (rate-limited by disulfide exchange) back into the bulk solution, which is the global energy minimum state of the system at basic pH.",introduction,N-methyltriazolium
"The final feature of the design is fluorescence readout of the crown ether position provided by incorporating a pyrene residue within the thread (Figure 2). The pyrene fluorescence is quenched by PET to the adjacent N-methyltriazolium group. (58?65) However, when the crown ether binds to the N-methyltriazolium site, the PET is disrupted, and under UV-irradiation centered around 343 nm, the pyrene fluoresces. In this way, the intensity of any fluorescence output can be linked to the position of the macrocycle on the molecular thread.",introduction,"crown ether, N-methyltriazolium"
"Treatment of 1 and 27-crown-9 (27C9) with CF3CO2H (an analog of CCl3CO2H that does not spontaneously decarboxylate) smoothly afforded a [2]rotaxane (as evidenced by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, see Supporting Information section 4.1) over the course of several days. The rate of threading was limited by slow exchange of the hydrazone barrier, which was easily improved by adding a catalytic amount of aniline. (69) The 1H NMR spectrum of the rotaxane product (Figure 3B) showed substantial shifts in the resonances of protons associated with the dibenzylammonium group (Hb–e) with respect to those in the protonated but unthreaded precursor, 1·H+ (Figure 3A). This confirmed the macrocycle to be situated at the dibenzylammonium site in this form of the rotaxane, i.e., the structure to be dba-2·H+ (the italicized prefix indicates the position of the macrocycle on the axle). Photoirradiation of rotaxane dba-2·H+ at 343 nm showed a weak emission profile with the characteristic shape of pyrene fluorescence (Figure 4, blue line, and Supporting Information section 5.3).",result and discussion,"27-crown-9, CF3CO2H, CCl3CO2H, hydrazone, aniline, dibenzylammonium"
"To transport the macrocycle of the rotaxane from the dba-site to the mt-site, excess triethylamine (Et3N) was added to dba-2·H+ to deprotonate the dibenzylammonium group. 1H NMR spectroscopy of the resulting structure (Figure 3C) showed downfield shifts of 0.7 and 0.2 ppm for Hg and Hh, respectively, compared to 1 (Figure 3D), indicating shuttling of the crown ether to the N-methyltriazolium group (i.e., co–conformation mt-2). In contrast to the protonated rotaxane (dba-2·H+) and the unprotonated but unthreaded axle (1), mt-2 was brightly fluorescent when irradiated at 343 nm (Figure 4, orange line), demonstrating that crown ether binding to the N-methyltriazolium group switched on the fluorescence response of the adjacent pyrene fluorophore.",result and discussion,"triethylamine (Et3N), dibenzylammonium, crown ether, N-methyltriazolium"
"Having demonstrated the stepwise operation of the transiently fluorescent energy ratchet, we initiated the same reaction cycle with a single pulse of CCl3CO2H (Figure 5A). Compound 1, 27C9, Et3N, and the reagents required to exchange hydrazone and disulfide blocking groups at different pHs (3, 4, and 5), were mixed in CD3CN, and a pulse of CCl3CO2H was added (Figure 5A). Within 5 min, the formation of some dba-2·H+ was apparent by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see Supporting Information section 4.3 and Figure S5) and increased to its maximum value over the course of 6 d (days). Upon consumption of the fuel, (16) the pH of the medium became basic and the presence of mt-2 (again, evident from 1H NMR spectroscopy) corresponded with a substantial increase in fluorescence of the solution under irradiation at 343 nm. Over the course of a further 12 h, the magnitude of the fluorescence response decreased, accompanied by the concomitant formation of 1 and 27C9 (Supporting Information section 4.3).",result and discussion,"CCl3CO2H, Et3N, hydrazone, disulfide, CD3CN, CCl3CO2H"
"1, 1·H+, dba-2·H+, and mt-2 all have intense absorption bands centered around 343 nm, which do not overlap with absorption bands of any of the reagents used in the ratcheting operation. The extinction coefficients are similar irrespective of the presence of the macrocycle (see Supporting Information sections 5.1 and 5.4). The fluorescence emission spectra (Figure 4) show that under irradiation at 343 nm, mt-2 has a fluorescence intensity ?10× higher than that of the other states of the ratchet, confirming that macrocycle binding to the N-methyltriazolium site disrupts PET from the pyrene.",result and discussion,N-methyltriazolium
"Fluorescence spectroscopy was then used to analyze both the threading and dethreading steps individually (Figure 5B). For the threading study, aliquots at different time points were collected from a pulsed-fuel reaction mixture, in the absence of 4 and 5 to inhibit dethreading, as the system becomes increasingly basic during decomposition of the CCl3CO2H. After 4 d, the threading process had reached an equilibrium distribution of ?7:3 rotaxane (2):thread (1) (see Supporting Information section 5.6). Disulfide exchange was then initiated by adding a large excess of 4 and 5, leading to rapid dethreading. The release of 1 and 27C9 was accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity down to the original level of the starting materials.",result and discussion,CCl3CO2H
"As disulfide exchange is the rate-limiting step for dethreading of mt-2, the process that switches off fluorescence in the ratcheting cycle, the duration of fluorescence could be varied by changing the concentration of 4 and 5. Similarly, the time available for the threading step and, following that, the onset of fluorescence varies according to the amount of fuel in each pulse (see Supporting Information section 5.7). Together, these two features offer a means of controlling the onset and end-point of transient fluorescence by the molecular ratchet.",result and discussion,disulfide
"The outcome and performance of the ratcheting cycle were reproducible over multiple pulses of fuel (Figure 5C). The use of more rapidly decomposing pulsed-fuel systems, such as CBr3CO2H (70) or the use of polar solvents such as DMSO, (71) could allow for shorter periods for the ratcheting cycle and correspondingly reduced times for reading “switch on” fluorescent symbols encoded on molecular tapes.",result and discussion,"CBr3CO2H, DMSO"
"The pulsed fuel mediated transformation of 1 ? 2 ? 1 is a model energy ratchet cycle that starts with the crown ether being pumped from solution onto the thread. The ring is then directionally transported along the track, where binding to a N-methyltriazolium group transiently switches on fluorescence (?10× increase in intensity) from an adjacent irradiated pyrene fluorophore, before the ring is returned to bulk solution off the other end of the track. The movements of the molecules in the ensemble are synchronized, as the stage of the ratcheting cycle is linked to the pH of the environment. All of this occurs in response to a single pulse of CCl3CO2H. The amount of fuel used in the pulse and of the disulfide exchange reagents can be used to vary both the period of the ratcheting cycle and the duration of the transient fluorescence. This would correspond to the time taken to read each symbol on a molecular tape. In principle, such a system could be used to read the presence or absence of fluorophores at different locations on the tape, each fluorophore only “switched on” for fluorescence output when the directionally transported macrocycle arrives at that position. Digits 0 and 1 could be encoded in sequence by the absence/presence of pyrene, but different fluorophores could also potentially be added (e.g., corresponding to the symbols 2, 3, etc.) to increase the base of digits for information storage. Intriguingly, the fluorophore switch-on system could even be combined with a stereochemistry encoded system (43) to generate molecular tapes where one message could be read through fluorescence and a different message on the same tape could be read through circular dichroism. Such systems are under investigation in our laboratory.",conclusion,"N-methyltriazolium, CCl3CO2H"
Fixing Flavins: Hijacking a Flavin Transferase for Equipping Flavoproteins with a Covalent Flavin Cofactor,title,"Flavins, Flavoproteins "
"Most flavin-dependent enzymes contain a dissociable flavin cofactor. We present a new approach for installing in vivo a covalent bond between a flavin cofactor and its host protein. By using a flavin transferase and carving a flavinylation motif in target proteins, we demonstrate that “dissociable” flavoproteins can be turned into covalent flavoproteins. Specifically, four different flavin mononucleotide-containing proteins were engineered to undergo covalent flavinylation: a light-oxygen-voltage domain protein, a mini singlet oxygen generator, a nitroreductase, and an old yellow enzyme-type ene reductase. Optimizing the flavinylation motif and expression conditions led to the covalent flavinylation of all four flavoproteins. The engineered covalent flavoproteins retained function and often exhibited improved performance, such as higher thermostability or catalytic performance. The crystal structures of the designed covalent flavoproteins confirmed the designed threonyl-phosphate linkage. The targeted flavoproteins differ in fold and function, indicating that this method of introducing a covalent flavin-protein bond is a powerful new method to create flavoproteins that cannot lose their cofactor, boosting their performance.",abstract,"flavin, protein, flavoproteins, oxygen"
"Flavoproteins are proteins that use flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as cofactors for their function. Most flavoproteins contain FAD or FMN as a dissociable cofactor. Only a minority of flavoproteins contain a covalently attached flavin cofactor, mostly involving a FAD. (1) So far, nine different types of covalent flavin-protein linkages have been identified in natural flavoproteins. The roles and mechanisms of the different modes of covalent flavinylation have been studied in detail. (2,3) It has been shown that the covalent bond between the flavin and the host protein can result in a more stable protein structure, (4?6) increased enzyme activity, (6,7) tuned redox properties of the enzyme, (7,8) prevent dissociation of the cofactor, (9) and facilitate electron transfer. (10) Most of the flavin-protein linkages involve a covalent bond between the benzyl moiety of the redox-active isoalloxazine ring system of FMN or FAD. Such a covalent linkage can be formed by a self-catalytic process. Only in one case is there tethering via the phosphate group of FMN. This covalent linkage was found to be formed with the help of an extracytosolic bacterial flavin transferase, which uses FAD for attaching the FMN part to the target threonine or serine. Genome sequence analysis has revealed that such covalently flavinylated proteins are common in bacteria and seem to be involved in various extracellular redox processes, often facilitating the transfer of single electrons.",introduction,"Flavoproteins, proteins, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), threonine, serine"
"We have recently shown that the above-mentioned flavin transferase can be used for directed labeling of target proteins with a covalent flavin, a flavin analogue, or even a nicotinamide group. By equipping a protein with an N- or C-terminal peptide that includes a flavinylation recognition site (DxxxGA[T/S], flavinylated amino acid in bold), FMN can be enzymatically attached using a truncated, and therefore soluble, version of the bacterial flavin transferase from Vibrio cholerae (ApbE). (11?13) We termed this approach Flavin-tagging and have successfully applied it for labeling several proteins with FMN or FMN derivatives with altered chromogenic, fluorescence, and redox properties. (13,14) The Flavin-tag system can be used as a convenient tool for decorating a target protein with a flavin-based probe. Selective covalent labeling can be achieved in vivo (by coexpressing the target protein and the flavin transferase) and in vitro (by incubating the target protein with the flavin transferase and FAD).",introduction,"nicotinamide, peptide, amino acid"
"Based on the Flavin-tag system, we set out to explore whether the flavin transferase can also be exploited to install a catalytically active flavin in a covalent manner into a target flavoprotein. To investigate this, we targeted four FMN-containing proteins that differ in structure and function and for which structural and functional properties are known: the light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain protein from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (PpSB1-LOV), the mini singlet oxygen generator engineered from Arabidopsis thaliana phototropin 2 (miniSOG), a bacterial nitroreductase (BtNR), and an old yellow enzyme (OYE)-type ene reductase from Thermus scotoductus.",introduction,"Flavin, proteins, oxygen"
"Aromaticity is typically regarded as an intrinsic property of a molecule, correlated with electron delocalization, stability, and other properties. Small variations in the molecular geometry usually result in small changes in aromaticity, in line with Hammond’s postulate. For example, introducing bond-length alternation in benzene and square cyclobutadiene by modulating the geometry along the Kekulé vibration gradually decreases the magnitude of their ring currents, making them less aromatic and less antiaromatic, respectively. A sign change in the ring current, corresponding to a reversal of aromaticity, typically requires a gross perturbation such as electronic excitation, addition or removal of two electrons, or a dramatic change in the molecular geometry. Here, we use multireference calculations to show how movement along the Kekulé vibration, which controls bond-length alternation, induces a sudden reversal in the ring current of cyclo[16]carbon, C16. This reversal occurs when the two orthogonal ? systems of C16 sustain opposing currents. These results are rationalized by a Hückel model which includes bond-length alternation, and which is combined with a minimal model accounting for orbital contributions to the ring current. Finally, we successfully describe the electronic structure of C16 with a “divide-and-conquer” approach suitable for execution on a quantum computer.",abstract,"benzene, cyclobutadiene, cyclo[16]carbon, C16"
"Aromaticity is one of the most debated concepts in chemistry, and its definition has undergone several revisions over the last few decades. (1?5) Today, the most commonly used criterion for aromaticity is magnetic, (2) equating the presence of a diatropic or paratropic ring current in an applied magnetic field with aromaticity or antiaromaticity, respectively. In molecules with several ? systems, local and/or global currents may be present simultaneously, (6,7) reinforcing or opposing each other. Aromaticity is a defining characteristic of a molecule, linked with reactivity, stability, HOMO–LUMO (8) and singlet–triplet gaps, (9) feasibility for singlet fission, (10) diradical character, (11) wave function coherence, (12) and other properties.
Cyclo[N]carbons are all-carbon rings with two orthogonal ? systems, usually with N electrons in each. (13) In an analogy to annulenes, cyclocarbons with N = 4n + 2 carbon atoms can be classed as doubly aromatic (with both ? systems sustaining a diatropic ring current), while N = 4n cyclocarbons are expected to be doubly antiaromatic. (14,15) Many cyclocarbons have been found in the gas phase, but only C10, (16) C14, (16) C16, (17) and C18 (18) have been structurally characterized using scanning probe microscopy.
A recent on-surface investigation of C16 revealed the presence of strong bond-length alternation (BLA) and confirmed that its ground state is doubly antiaromatic. (17) Here, we investigate the variation of aromaticity with geometry in the two lowest singlets (S0 and S1), the lowest triplet (T1) and quintet (Q1) state of C16. Surprisingly, we find that the total ring current in the S1 and T1 states can be reversed from aromatic to antiaromatic by movement along the Kekulé vibration (?2300 cm–1), i.e., by changing the amount of bond-length alternation. (19) These aromaticity reversals require a relatively small amount of energy, in contrast with previous reports which require a change in the electronic state, (20?23) molecular charge (24?26) or composition, (27,28) or involve a high-lying transition state (29,30) or a highly strained geometry. (31) To our knowledge, the only comparable low-energy aromaticity reversal involves a conformational equilibrium between Hückel antiaromatic and Möbius aromatic conformers in a hexaphyrin derivative.

The simplicity and unique electronic structure of cyclocarbons makes them an interesting testing ground for theoretical methods. (13) Quantum algorithms, which strongly benefit from execution on a quantum computer, are a promising avenue for the further development of electronic structure methods. However, their execution on current quantum devices is limited by noise and coherence time. (34,35) Here, we exploit the orthogonality between the two ? systems of C16 to effectively increase the active space of the quantum unitary coupled clusters singles doubles (q-UCCSD) method, (36) which we solve variationally. (37) This divide-and-conquer approach enables us to obtain highly accurate results that would otherwise not be feasible to compute using near-term quantum devices.",introduction,"Cyclo[N]carbons, annulenes, cyclocarbons, C16, cyclocarbons"
"In cells, a vast number of membrane lipids are formed by the enzymatic O-acylation of polar head groups with acylating agents such as fatty acyl-CoAs. Although such ester-containing lipids appear to be a requirement for life on earth, it is unclear if similar types of lipids could have spontaneously formed in the absence of enzymatic machinery at the origin of life. There are few examples of enzyme-free esterification of amphiphiles in water and none that can occur in water at physiological pH using biochemically relevant acylating agents. Here we report the unexpected chemoselective O-acylation of 1,2-amino alcohol amphiphiles in water directed by Cu(II) and several other transition metal ions. In buffers containing Cu(II) ions, mixing biological 1,2-amino alcohol amphiphiles such as sphingosylphosphorylcholine with biochemically relevant acylating agents, namely, acyl adenylates and acyl-CoAs, leads to the formation of the O-acylation product with high selectivity. The resulting O-acylated sphingolipids self-assemble into vesicles with markedly different biophysical properties than those formed from their N-acyl counterparts. We also demonstrate that Cu(II) can direct the O-acylation of alternative 1,2-amino alcohols, including prebiotically relevant 1,2-amino alcohol amphiphiles, suggesting that simple mechanisms for aqueous esterification may have been prevalent on earth before the evolution of enzymes.",abstract,"lipids, fatty acyl-CoAs, ester, 1,2-amino alcohol, Cu(II), sphingosylphosphorylcholine, acyl-CoAs, sphingolipids"
"Cocrystallization of a cis-azobenzene dye with volatile molecules, such as pyrazine and dioxane, leads to materials that exhibit at least three different light-intensity-dependent responses upon irradiation with low-power visible light. The halogen-bond-driven assembly of the dye cis-(p-iodoperfluorophenyl)azobenzene with volatile halogen bond acceptors produces cocrystals whose light-induced behavior varies significantly depending on the intensity of the light applied. Low-intensity (<1 mW·cm–2) light irradiation leads to a color change associated with low levels of cis ? trans isomerization. Irradiation at higher intensities (150 mW·mm–2) produces photomechanical bending, caused by more extensive isomerization of the dye. At still higher irradiation intensities (2.25 W·mm–2) the cocrystals undergo cold photocarving; i.e., they can be cut and written on with micrometer precision using laser light without a major thermal effect. Real-time Raman spectroscopy shows that this novel photochemical behavior differs from what would be expected from thermal energy input alone. Overall, this work introduces a rational blueprint, based on supramolecular chemistry in the solid state, for new types of crystalline light-responsive materials, which not only respond to being exposed to light but also change their response based on the light intensity.",abstract,"cis-azobenzene, pyrazine, dioxane, cis-(p-iodoperfluorophenyl)azobenzene, halogen"
"Modulating the optical or photoresponsive properties of solid-state materials by light, i.e., inducing changes in shape, (1,2) reversible or irreversible photomechanical motion, (3?9) or optical properties, (10) is of great interest for applications including molecular robotics, (11) nanoactuators, (12) and light harvesting. (13) Control over optical properties of crystalline materials has attracted attention in the context of organic semiconductors, (14) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), (15) elastic materials, (16) or waveguides. (17,18) Photoresponsive behavior in organic solids has been accomplished through a wide range of transformations, including diverse isomerization, (19,20) polymerization, (15,16) and dimerization reactions. (21?26) The formation of multicomponent crystals (cocrystals) is a powerful crystal engineering and supramolecular strategy to tune the solid-state environment of an organic molecule, enabling the optimization of solid-state properties or even the development of materials with entirely new properties. (27,28) Notable applications of cocrystal formation include the development of pharmaceutical solid forms, (29,30) the design of mechano-, photo-, or thermoresponsive materials, (31,32) organic semiconducting solids, optical materials, and more. (33) Cocrystallization was also found to provide access to complex solid-state behavior, e.g., materials exhibiting different types of response depending on the choice of stimulus. (34)
The use of azobenzene-based (azo) dyes as cocrystal components was recently shown to enable access to materials with unique and controllable photomechanical or enhanced optical behavior, including crystal shaping, as well as dichroism and/or pleochroism by design. (35,36) We have recently shown that cocrystallization of a trans-azobenzene (trans-azo) dye with a volatile cocrystal former enables the design of a new class of organic solids: dye-volatile cocrystals which can undergo “cold photocarving” (CPC), i.e., micrometer-precision cutting, shaping, or embossing upon irradiation with low-energy visible light, through an optical and not a thermal mechanism. (37) While conventional machining and photolithography techniques have previously been used to cut or introduce micrometer-size engravings into polymers, (38) polymeric resins, (39) cocrystal thin films, (36) photonic crystals, (40) hyperbolic metamaterials, (41) and nanostructures, (42) such thermal processes typically require laser powers on the order of kW per mm2 to GW per mm2 or, as in the case of focused ion beam milling, the use of other types of high-energy beams. (43?45) In contrast, the CPC behavior enabled through the dye-volatile cocrystal design does not involve high-temperature disruption of covalent bonds but instead gentle, low-temperature, and localized cleavage of noncovalent interactions, such as halogen bonds (XB). (46) Notably, XBs were shown to be relevant for altering the photoresponsive behavior in liquid crystals and crystalline solids. (47) As a result, CPC can achieve micrometer-precision surface and volume effects, using laser beams with only a small fraction of the intensity compared to those used for traditional machining and photolithography techniques. (38) Here we report that the use of a cis-azobenzene dye (cis-azo) as a component of the dye-volatile cocrystal design provides access to photoresponsive molecular crystals that can undergo at least three distinct types of photoinduced response upon visible light irradiation. Combining a fluorinated cis-azo XB donor with volatile XB acceptors dioxane or pyrazine produces cocrystals (cis-azo)(dioxane) and (cis-azo)(pyrazine) (Figure 1a) which selectively, and depending on the irradiation light intensity, undergo optical color change, photomechanical bending, or photocarving. Each of these optical responses, which result from using the photoswitchable cis-azo unit as a cocrystal component, can be achieved in the same crystal by careful control of laser irradiation parameters, including power and beam diameter",introduction,"trans-azobenzene (trans-azo), halogen bonds, cis-azobenzene dye (cis-azo), dioxane, pyrazine, (cis-azo)(dioxane), (cis-azo)(pyrazine) "
"Yellow needle-shaped single crystals of (cis-azo)(dioxane) were obtained by slow evaporation of a solution of cis-azo in dioxane. Structural analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the structure consists of zigzag chains held together by I···O halogen bonds (Figure 1b, also Supplementary Figure 2). The I···O distance of 2.854(2) Å (corresponding to the RXB parameter; (48) i.e., the ratio of the I···O distance to the sum of the van der Waals radii (49) of O and I atoms of 0.815 was found to be notably shorter than for the analogous (trans-azo)(dioxane) cocrystal (dI···O = 2.981(3) Å, RXB = 0.852). (37) The photoresponsive behavior of (cis-azo)(dioxane) crystals was studied under irradiation with either blue or green light, using wavelength 488, 515, or 532 nm, in which cis-azo absorbs (Supplementary Figure 3). Irradiation at the lowest light intensity was achieved using a 532 nm dispersed light-emitting diode (LED) of approximately 37 mW cm–2 output power at the source, placed 10 cm away from the crystal. Experiments at higher light intensities were performed using an in-house laser system (Supplementary Figure 4), which included one or two separate laser beams. In a typical experiment, the laser beam was passed through a 50:50 beam splitter, with the transmitted beam passing through a series of optical elements to increase and collimate the size of the beam prior to reaching the sample. The reflected beam, on the other hand, was passed through a different series of optical elements, including a neutral density filter and a convex lens, which reduced the diameter and thus increased the intensity of the beam, reaching the sample orthogonal to the transmitted beam. The use of this system enabled simple, shutter-controlled switching between a laser beam of lower light intensity with a larger diameter (the transmitted beam) and a beam of higher light intensity with a lower diameter (the reflected beam). The beam diameters were determined using the “knife edge” technique to be 78 ?m and 2 mm for the reflected and transmitted beams, respectively (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6).",result and discussion,"cis-azo, dioxane, halogen, trans-azo"
"Commercially available zeolite Y modulates the catalytic activity and selectivity of ultrasmall silver species during the Buchner reaction and the carbene addition to methylene and hydroxyl bonds, by simply exchanging the counter cations of the zeolite framework. The zeolite acts as a macroligand to tune the silver catalytic site, enabling the use of this cheap and recyclable solid catalyst for the in situ formation of carbenes from diazoacetate and selective insertion in different C–H (i.e., cyclohexane) and C–O (i.e., water) bonds. The amount of catalyst in the reaction can be as low as ?0.1 mol % silver. Besides, this reactivity allows deeply drying the HY zeolite framework by making the strongly adsorbed water molecules react with the in situ formed carbenes.",abstract,"zeolite, carbene, methylene, hydroxyl, diazoacetate, cyclohexane"
"Ag-supported zeolites have been known for decades (1) and found application in diverse fields such as antimicrobial agents, (2) adsorbents of methyl iodide in nuclear power plants, (3) and catalysts for methane activation, (4) 1-butene dimerization, (5) and nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide redox reactions, (6) among others. (7) However, it is difficult to find in the literature the use of Ag-supported zeolites as catalysts for fine organic synthesis, despite the paramount relevance of Ag as catalyst in many organic transformations. (8,9) The lack of examples with Ag zeolites is due to the tendency of Ag to aggregate inside the zeolite and block the pores, hampering the diffusion and reactivity of molecules composed by more than three or four atoms. (10)
In the past decade, the advent of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has spurred the investigation of solid supports to generate and stabilize SACs on surfaces, with applications in organic synthesis. (11) In this regard, Ag is one of the more interesting chemical elements to be stabilized as a SAC, since its tendency to easily agglomerate, even with just ambient light, has severely hampered the study of the catalytic behavior of single- and few-atoms Ag entities, beyond those prepared by atom deposition or electrochemical techniques. (12) Our group has recently reported the synthesis of Ag dimers (Ag2) in metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and their use as catalysts for the Buchner reaction, (13a) the oxidation sulfonation of styrenes, (13b) and the methanation of CO2. (13c) However, single Ag atoms could not be prepared, and the electronics of the catalytically active Ag site were fixed by the MOF surroundings, without any room for catalytic tunability.
Here, we show that the commercially available, robust, and crystalline microporous aluminosilicate zeolite Y stabilizes catalytically active single Ag atoms and subnanometric clusters inside its cavities, after wet exchange with AgNO3 and calcination under air at 450 °C. Figure 1 shows that the charge-compensating cations of the zeolite regulate the electron density on the Ag site. (14) When going from H+ to Cs+, the electron density of the framework increases, since the bigger (softer) the counter cation, the higher the electron density on the framework, which is ultimately received by the Ag sites. (15) In other words, a regulated electron flow occurs internally in the zeolite from the counter cation site to the Ag site, since the less electronegative counter cations, i.e. Cs+, enable more electron density to be received by Ag. If one also considers the difference in size between counter cations, an array of different electronic and steric Ag-supported materials, with potential application in a diversity of organic reactions, is easily obtained.",introduction,"Ag, methane, 1-butene, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, CO2, AgNO3, H+, Cs+"
"We will show here that the resulting zeolites catalyze representative carbene-mediated reactions in organic synthesis, such as the Buchner reaction and acetate insertion in methylene and hydroxyl bonds. (16,17) The Ag-zeolite enables the reaction of C–H and C–O bonds without requiring prefunctionalized substrates or leaving groups (such as halides, etc.), and not only the catalytic activity but also the selectivity of the reaction is dictated by the counter cation of the zeolite. To our knowledge, these carbene-mediated reactions are rarely catalyzed by a solid support, (18) and some of them are here catalyzed by Ag for the first time.",introduction,"carbene, methylene, hydroxyl, Ag"
"Commercially available H-USY zeolite features the lowest framework electron density among all cation-counterbalanced Y zeolites (see Figure 1); thus it was first chosen to support Ag, in order to minimize the reduction and agglomeration of the metal. Ag-HY zeolite was prepared by cationic exchange of H-USY zeolite (Si/Al = 15) with a solution of AgNO3 in water, to incorporate 1.08 wt % of Ag after calcination at 450 °C in air, according to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Table S1 in the Supporting Information). This calcination temperature was chosen to decompose the nitrate ligands, as assessed by the lack of N in the elemental analysis (EA) of the calcined sample and also by the thermogravimetric analysis (TG, see Figure S8). It is worth commenting here that the cationic exchange method is preferred to the incipient wetness methodology since the former gives a homogeneous distribution of Ag cations on the zeolite surface and a stronger Ag–zeolite interaction, while the latter produces a heterogeneous distribution prone to facilitate the aggregation of Ag.",result and discussion,"AgNO3, Ag"
"In order to further check the oxidation and aggregation state of cationic Ag+ in Ag-HY, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with carbon monoxide (CO) as a probe and also X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, were carried out. Figure 2 shows the results. The low-temperature DRIFTS-CO analysis shows main bands at 2180 and 2192 cm–1, assignable to linearly coordinated Ag+(CO) and Ag+(CO)2, respectively, (6c,21) together with the expected band at 2158 cm–1 corresponding to the interaction between CO and the strong protons of HY zeolite. (23) Although some minor bands can be detected at lower wavenumbers (i.e., the band at 2133 cm–1), it can be said here that cationic Ag species are mainly observed for the Ag-HY sample",result and discussion,carbon monoxide (CO)
"The new Ag-HY and Ag-HYcal zeolites were tested as catalysts for the Buchner reaction, a classical transformation in organic synthesis where a direct insertion of a carbene into the aromatic C–H bond followed by a C–C bond rearrangement occurs, which leads to otherwise very difficult to obtain cycloheptatrienes. (25) Table 1 shows the catalytic results for the reaction between ethyldiazoacetate (EDA) 1 and toluene 2 as a solvent (0.15 M), at 60 °C. For this aromatic substrate, alternatively, the insertion of the carbene into the methyl C–H bond to give the corresponding benzyl ester could also occur. The results show that the reaction does not proceed without a catalyst (entry 1), and soluble AgNO3 gives an 80% yield of the products (entry 2), mainly C–H insertion. The benchmark Rh2(OAc)4 catalyst for the Buchner reaction (25b) gives a 42% yield of Buchner product 3 and 20% of C–H insertion product 4 plus dimers (35%, entry 3). Thus, it seems that AgNO3 is more active and more selective that Rh2(OAc)4 under the present reaction conditions. With this in mind, it could very well occur that Ag-HY is also active in the carbene-mediated reaction. Notice that products 3 and 4 are both formed after N2 release and carbene formation, but while product 3 comes from the cyclopropanation reaction of the triplet carbene of 1 with the C?C double bonds of toluene 2 (Buchner reaction), product 4 comes from the insertion of the singlet carbene of 1 into the C–H methyl bond of 2. In other words, both reactions follow distinct activation mechanisms for 1, of course directed by the electronics (and perhaps sterics) of the catalytic metal site.",result and discussion,"carbene, cycloheptatrienes, ethyldiazoacetate, (EDA), toluene, methyl, benzyl ester, AgNO3, Rh2(OAc)4 , AgNO3, N2"
"The noncalcined Ag-HY zeolite shows complete conversion of 1; however, to our surprise, the main products found were 5 and 6, presumably coming from the insertion of the carbene in the O–H bond of water present in the zeolite (entry 4), (26) and only a 19% yield of C–H coupled products could be obtained. After calcination, Ag-HYcal shows a significant increase toward the C–C bond-forming coupled products 3 (5%) and 4 (31%); however, the main product still comes from water insertion (62%, entry 5). This result indicates that the more strongly adsorbed water molecules in the Ag-exchanged HY zeolite are acting as a reactant during the carbene reaction.
Reaction tests with 1 or 10 equiv of externally added water were carried out (Figure S7), and the results show that the reaction proceeds with complete conversion of 1 and that the product selectivity is not much varied, in other words, that external water does not participate during the O–H insertion found. Indeed, the in situ drying of the zeolite by applying vacuum at 250 °C before reaction did not improve the yield toward 3 + 4 (entry 6). Since the Ag-HYcal zeolite has lost most of the physisorbed water molecules but keeps the strongly chemisorbed water according to the corresponding TG (Figure S8), it could happen that the reuse of the zeolite will eliminate most of the O–H insertion products throughout the reuses, since chemisorbed water would become already reacted in the previous use and any external water added by the reagents would just exert a minimal influence in the reaction. In other words, the reaction of the zeolite with 1 was used as a method to deeply dry the zeolite framework of any adsorbed water molecules.",result and discussion,"Ag, carbene, zeolite"
"The higher catalytic activity of the alkaline-exchanged zeolites with respect to Ag-HY toward the C–C bond-forming products 3 and 4 could be due to an intrinsic higher selectivity of the Ag catalytic site for C–C and C–H bond activation or simply to a lack of water in the zeolite once dried. However, the FT-IR spectra of the calcined solids show similar amounts of adsorbed water in all zeolites (Figure S3). In order to check if Ag-(Li to K)NaYcal zeolites are less catalytically active than Ag-HYcal toward the insertion of the carbene in the O–H bonds, the catalytic reaction of EDA 1 in a mixture of water/ethanol 7 was performed. Ethanol 7 was coadded to water in order to assess the reactivity of an external O–H bond, not present in the zeolite. The results in Figure 4 show that the Ag-HYcal catalyst gives three times more yield of O–H insertion products 5 + 8 than the alkaline zeolites; indeed, product 8 is the major product. Thus, we can conclude that the higher catalytic activity of Ag-(Li to K)NaYcal zeolites to products 3 and 4 comes from a better intrinsic selectivity of the Ag catalysts toward C–C and C–H bond activation, while Ag-HYcal prefers to activate and insert the carbene in O–H bonds. Indeed, other alcohols such as 2-chloroethanol (98% yield), phenylethanol (98% yield), allyl alcohol (97% yield), and propargyl alcohol (95% yield) engaged extremely well in the Ag-HYcal-catalyzed reaction. In summary, the counter cation nature and not the water content is the major parameter affecting the activity and selectivity of the carbene insertion reaction: while HY directs the insertion toward O–H bonds in the presence of O-containing nucleophiles (such as water and alcohols) and toward C–C and C–H bonds, equally, without water in the reaction media, alkaline-earth cations divert the insertion toward C–C and C–H bonds, in an approximately 1:2 ratio (Figure S17). These selectivity results make sense if we consider that O–H bonds are much more polar than C?C or C–H bonds; thus, the higher the electron deficiency in the Ag catalytic site (the more Lewis acid the Ag is), the better the activation of the O–H vs C?C or C–H bonds.",result and discussion,"Ag, ethanol, alkaline zeolites, 2-chloroethanol, phenylethanol, allyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol"
"A product and DFT computational study on the reactions of 3-ethyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (ETFDO) with bicyclic and spirocyclic hydrocarbons bearing cyclopropyl groups was carried out. With bicyclo[n.1.0]alkanes (n = 3–6), diastereoselective formation of the alcohol product derived from C2–H bond hydroxylation was observed, accompanied by smaller amounts of products derived from oxygenation at other sites. With 1-methylbicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, rearranged products were also observed in addition to the unrearranged products deriving from oxygenation at the most activated C2–H and C5–H bonds. With spiro[2.5]octane and 6-tert-butylspiro[2.5]octane, reaction with ETFDO occurred predominantly or exclusively at the axial C4–H to give unrearranged oxygenation products, accompanied by smaller amounts of rearranged bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-1-ols. The good to outstanding site-selectivities and diastereoselectivities are paralleled by the calculated activation free energies for the corresponding reaction pathways. Computations show that the ?* orbitals of the bicyclo[n.1.0]alkane cis or trans C2–H bonds and spiro[2.5]octanes axial C4–H bond hyperconjugatively interact with the Walsh orbitals of the cyclopropane ring, activating these bonds toward HAT to ETFDO. The detection of rearranged oxygenation products in the oxidation of 1-methylbicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, spiro[2.5]octane, and 6-tert-butylspiro[2.5]octane provides unambiguous evidence for the involvement of cationic intermediates in these reactions, representing the first examples on the operation of ET pathways in dioxirane-mediated C(sp3)–H bond oxygenations.

"Herein, we report an intermolecular [3+2]-cycloaddition of electron-poor olefins with cyclopropylanilines under visible light photocatalysis. The process is initiated by visible light, leading to the formation of cyclopentachromene derivatives. However, at the outset of our studies, challenges related to the radical nature of the transformation, its diastereoselectivity, and the utilization of trisubstituted olefin had to be considered.",introduction,cyclopropylanilines
"Initially, the [3+2]-photocycloaddition between chromen-4-one 5a and N-cyclopropylaniline 2a was performed in CH2Cl2 in the presence of fac-Ir(ppy)3 as a photocatalyst under irradiation with blue light and an inert atmosphere (Table 1, entry 1). As expected, no reaction was observed, which indicated the crucial role of the EWG-activation of 5 in the devised methodology. As highlighted in our previous work, the incorporation of an electron-withdrawing group into the chromenone is necessary to increase its electrophilic properties and hence for the reaction to occur. Therefore, the activation of 5 through the introduction of various activating groups in the 3-position was attempted (Table 1, entries 2–4). Most of the tested derivatives displayed no reactivity under these conditions, and the application of the CN group was crucial for the developed transformation (the cyano group exhibits a stronger electron-withdrawing effect when compared to other tested electron-deficient groups). Cycloaddition between 3-cyanochromone 1a and N-cyclopropylaniline 2a resulted in the formation of the desired product (Table 1, entry 4). The corresponding cyclopenta[b]chromeno-carbonitrile 3aa was obtained with 57% yield as a mixture of two diastereoisomers, which differed in the configuration on the C-1 stereogenic center. The importance of the nitrile group for the developed reactivity is presumably related to the ability of this group to stabilize both radical and anionic intermediates. (11,12) Various factors such as solvent, photocatalyst, and reaction concentration were tested in the course of optimization studies, while the temperature and N-cyclopropylaniline equivalents were held constant throughout. In the first part, the catalytic activity of five different photoredox catalysts was examined (with the irradiation with the light source of suitable wavelength) (Table 1, entries 4–8). All tested catalysts 4a–e provided the desired reactivity with the best results obtained in the presence of Eosin Y (Table 1, entry 7). During further investigations, the effect of the solvent on the reaction outcome was evaluated (Table 1, entries 7 and 9–13). This part of the studies revealed dimethyl sulfoxide to be the best solvent, providing the target product in 82% yield and with the diastereoisomer ratio at a level of 5:1 (Table 1, entry 13). Change in the amount of the catalyst negatively affected reaction efficiency (Table 1, entries 13–15). Subsequently, the effect of the reaction concentration on both the yield and diastereoselectivity was evaluated, but neither increasing nor decreasing improved the results of the cycloaddition (Table 1, entries 13, 16, and 17). Eventually, cyclopenta[b]chromeno-carbonitrile 3aa was formed in the presence of 5 mol% of Eosin Y in DMSO in 82% yield as a mixture of diastereoisomers in the 5:1 ratio. These results were validated on an initial scale up to 1.0 mmol, providing 3aa in 75% yield (Table 1, entry 19). A series of control experiments demonstrated that the reaction did not take place in the absence of a photocatalyst or in the dark, indicating the crucial effect of a photoredox catalyst and the source of light on the reaction outcome (Table 1, entries 20 and 21). Finally, the experiment in the presence of TEMPO was carried out, and no reaction was observed, thus confirming the radical nature of the developed reaction (Table 1, entry 22).",result and discussion,"CH2Cl2, 3-cyanochromone, N-cyclopropylaniline, cyclopenta[b]chromeno-carbonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, TEMPO "
"With the optimized reaction conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 13), the applicability of the developed methodology with regard to both reaction partners was examined (Schemes 3 and 4). Initially, various 3-cyanochromones 1a–i containing either electron-withdrawing or donating substituents were tested in the [3+2]-photocycloaddition with N-cyclopropylaniline 2a (Scheme 3). To our delight, the reaction proceeded efficiently, and in most cases, the desired products were obtained with yields in the range of 70–80%. Only for the 3-cyanochromones 1g, h with a methyl substituent in the 6- and 7-position, the yield of the reaction lowered to 58 and 59%, respectively. In this context, it is worth noting that for the example with a chlorine substituent on the aromatic ring of 3-cyanochromone 1f the cycloaddition proceeded with an excellent yield, and it was as high as 93%. Gratifyingly, the studies also indicated that the position of the substituent in 3-cyanochromone 1 had no pronounced influence on the reaction outcome, and the introduction of two substituents on the aromatic ring was also possible (Scheme 3, product 3ia). In terms of diastereoselectivity, the cycloaddition was found to be unbiased toward the electronic properties of substituents, and it remained at a similar level to the model reaction.",result and discussion,"3-cyanochromones, N-cyclopropylaniline"
"In the second part of the scope studies, the possibility of employing various N-arylcyclopropylamines 2a–f in the devised strategy was tested (Scheme 4). Unfortunately, it was found that the efficiency of the cascade reaction decreased, and target products 3ab–3af were obtained in yields within the range of 42–82%. The lowest efficiency was obtained when N-cyclopropylaniline with an electron-accepting chlorine substituent was applied; in addition, the diastereoselectivity of the process decreased and amounted to only 2:1 dr (Scheme 4, product 3af). In some of the cases, it was required to extend the reaction time from 24 to 72 h in order to achieve full conversion (Scheme 4, products 3ad, 3ae). To our delight, for the example with two trifluoromethyl groups on the aromatic ring of the N-cyclopropylaniline 2e the diastereoselectivity of the cycloaddition increased to 10:1 dr. Unfortunately, for monosubstituted N-cyclopropylaniline 2f the diastereomeric ratio remained at a moderate level.",result and discussion,"N-arylcyclopropylamines, N-cyclopropylaniline"
"In order to assign the relative configuration of target products 3, single-crystal X-ray analysis was performed. To our delight, the major diastereoisomer of 3ae provided crystals suitable for this experiment. (13) The relative configuration of all major diastereoisomers of 3 was established by analogy (Scheme 5). To get insight into the reaction mechanism, a set of control experiments was performed (Table 1, entries 20–22) and the control reaction with TEMPO is consistent with a radical mechanism. Consequently, the catalytic cycle of the reaction and the stereochemical model accounting for the formation of the major diastereomer were proposed (Scheme 5b). It is postulated that the oxidation of N-cyclopropylaniline 2a by a photoexcited catalyst initiates the reaction to form the corresponding amine radical cation 5. Then ring-opening of 5 affords the distonic radical cation 6 and the cycloaddition leads to the annulation of the five-membered ring, yielding the amine radical 7. The approach of radical 6 to substrate 1 is governed by steric factors. The subsequent reduction of 7 leads to the target product 3aa and the regeneration of catalyst Eosin Y, which restarts the catalytic cycle",result and discussion,"TEMPO, N-cyclopropylaniline, amine"
"In summary, we have developed a new visible-light-mediated synthetic methodology, leading to the formation of hybrid molecules containing chromone and cyclopentane rings. The protocol was realized in the presence of 5 mol % of Eosin Y as a catalyst in dry DMSO as a solvent. The presented methodology gives access to fourteen functionalized cyclopenta[b]chromenocarbonitriles 3aa–3ag under mild reaction conditions in good yields and diastereoselectivity. The utility of the obtained products was demonstrated in chemoselective reduction.",conclusion,"cyclopentane, DMSO, cyclopenta[b]chromenocarbonitriles"
"The first example of the Kumada–Tamao–Corriu type reaction of unprotected bromoanilines with Grignard reagents is described. The method uses a palladium source and a newly designed Buchwald-type ligand as the catalytic system. Secondary and tertiary bromo- and iodoamines were also successfully coupled to alkyl Grignard reagents. The products of the competitive ?-hydride elimination reaction were successfully reduced using a highly efficient electron-deficient phosphine ligand (BPhos). Mechanistic considerations allowed us to establish that the less electron-rich phosphine ligands stabilize the transition state much better than the electron-rich ones; hence, they increase the reaction yield and reduce the amount of ?-hydride elimination products. The developed method proved to be tolerant of many functional groups and can be applied to many different aromatic bromo- and iodoamines. Multigram synthesis of p-toluidine from 4-bromoaniline was achieved with a palladium catalyst loading of only 0.03 mol%.",abstract,"Grignard reagents, palladium, bromo- and iodoamines, alkyl Grignard reagents, phosphine ligand, (BPhos), p-toluidine, 4-bromoaniline "
"Direct introduction of an alkyl group to an aromatic ring of primary aromatic amines remains a challenging transformation. Electrophilic Friedel–Crafts-type alkylation reactions are of limited scope due to the deactivation of the Lewis acid by an unprotected NH2 group and/or competitive alkylation reactions on the nitrogen atom. However, few synthetic methods were reported, including catalytic alkylations with organozinc compounds, (1?5) and a few other catalytic methods (6?10) or reactions utilizing protonated anilines. (11,12) The C(sp2)–C(sp3) catalytic coupling reactions between aromatic halides and aliphatic organometallics have attracted significant attention in recent years. These types of C–C coupling reactions constitute an efficient tool for rapid and predictive increase of molecular complexity of aromatic compounds. The advantage of these reactions is the availability of the starting materials, organometallic reagents (i.e., Zn, B), catalysts (Pd, Ni, Fe), and phosphine ligands. (2,3,13?19) Importantly, the newly formed C–C bond is introduced with a high degree of regioselectivity, making this method suitable for late-stage modification of complex molecules as a large-scale synthesis of intermediates. However, if organometallics more complex than methyl derivatives are used, ?-hydride elimination takes place as a side reaction, resulting in an overall decrease in yield.",introduction,"alkyl, amines, NH2, nitrogen atom, organozinc, aromatic halides, aliphatic organometallics, phosphine, methyl "
The utilization of the Grignard reagents (the Kumada–Tamao–Corriu reaction) in such couplings is particularly attractive due to their commercial availability and easy synthetic accessibility. (20) This article reports the coupling of the unprotected iodo- and bromosubstituted aromatic amines with simple alkylmagnesium bromides under mild conditions. We also report a highly efficient Buchwald-type phosphine ligand that allows for the reduction of ?-hydride elimination side reactions.,introduction,"Grignard reagents, iodo- and bromosubstituted aromatic amines, alkylmagnesium bromides"
"Our work commenced with screening commercially available phosphine ligands for coupling 4-iodooaniline (1a) and 4-bromoaniline (1b) with methylmagnesium bromide and n-butylmagnesium bromide. The reactions were performed by the addition of phosphine ligand and a palladium source mixture to the vial or a Schlenk tube containing the starting material and the Grignard reagent in anhydrous THF under inert gas. After the initial screening, Pd2(dba)3 and phosphine ligand in a 1:3 molar ratio were used as the catalytic system for reactions with MeMgBr. In the case of n-BuMgBr, [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 proved to be more efficient (see the Supporting Information for details). In all experiments, 3-fold excess of the Grignard reagent was used as we assumed that at least 1 equiv of this reagent is consumed for the deprotonation of the free NH2 group. Indeed, the addition of the Grignard reagent is an exothermic process proceeding with a gas release that results in the warming up of the reaction mixture, which in turn leads to the acceleration of the process and completion of the reaction within minutes. Although this phenomenon may be considered beneficial, it generates difficulties in comparing individual catalytic systems. Therefore, we decided to add the Grignard reagents at 0 °C, then the reaction mixtures were allowed to reach the ambient temperature for 10 min, the catalytic system was then added, and the time required to achieve reaction completion was determined by GC-MS.",result and discussion,"phosphine, 4-iodooaniline, 4-bromoaniline, methylmagnesium bromide, n-butylmagnesium bromide, Grignard reagent, anhydrous THF, Pd2(dba)3, phosphine, MeMgBr, n-BuMgBr, [Pd(allyl)Cl]2, NH2"
"Commercially available Buchwald ligands (see Supporting Information for structures), containing t-butyl groups on the phosphorus atom (JohnPhos, t-BuXPhos, t-BuBrettPhos, t-BuDavePhos, Me4t-BuXPhos, and TrixiePhos) gave poor results in the coupling of MeMgBr with 1a (Scheme 1). This is in sharp contrast to the cyclohexyl substituted phosphines (CyJohnPhos, BrettPhos, DavePhos, CPhos, RuPhos, and SPhos), which gave much higher yields of p-toluidine than their t-butyl analogs. In the case of CPhos, RuPhos, and SPhos, the reaction was complete in less than 1 h, and after a 4-fold reduction in the catalyst load, the reaction came to an end within 18 h.",result and discussion,"t-butyl, phosphorus atom, JohnPhos, t-BuXPhos, t-BuBrettPhos, t-BuDavePhos, Me4t-BuXPhos, and TrixiePhos, MeMgBr, cyclohexyl, phosphines, CyJohnPhos, BrettPhos, DavePhos, CPhos, RuPhos, and SPhos, p-toluidine, CPhos, RuPhos, and SPhos"
"Encouraged by these results, we found that also the 4-bromoaniline (1b) can be transformed into p-toluidine with XPhos, t-BuXPhos, SPhos, and CPhos ligands, although longer reaction times were required in most cases. It should be noted that the best result was achieved using t-BuXPhos, a ligand that was inefficient in the coupling of 1a.",result and discussion,"4-bromoaniline, p-toluidine, XPhos, t-BuXPhos, SPhos, CPhos, t-BuXPhos"
"Further tests, using n-BuMgBr instead of MeMgBr, revealed that Grignard reagents of longer primary alkyl chain give worse results in the coupling with 1b, and the significant contribution of the ?-hydride elimination product 2c was observed in these cases. The screening reactions were performed for 24 h, and it was observed that again phosphines containing t-butyl groups proved to be less effective than those containing cyclohexyl groups. Both groups gave large amounts of aniline side product, and only for XPhos, CPhos, SPhos, and RuPhos, conversions were higher than 50%. A comparison of ligands that differ only in the substituents on the phosphine-containing ring (t-BuXPhos vs t-BuBrettPhos vs Me4t-BuXPhos or XPhos vs BrettPhos) shows that electron-donating substituents on the ring slow the reaction and increase the amount of 2c. This observation raised the question of whether electron-withdrawing substituents present in phosphine ligands may accelerate the reaction and reduce the ?-hydride elimination products. To address this question, we designed and synthesized the CF3-substituted analogs of XPhos, CPhos, and SPhos. Moreover, P-isopropyl derivatives of those ligands were also synthesized to check if reduced steric hindrance on the phosphorus atom alters reactivity and contribution of ?-hydride elimination in the overall process (see Figure 1 for the structures of newly synthesized phosphine ligands). All newly synthesized compounds were obtained in one-pot syntheses, starting from the corresponding bromobenzenes or 2-bromobiphenyls, by metalation and reaction with chlorophosphines (for synthetic details, see Supporting Information).",result and discussion,"n-BuMgBr, MeMgBr, alkyl, phosphines, t-butyl, cyclohexyl, XPhos, CPhos, SPhos, and RuPhos, t-BuXPhos, t-BuBrettPhos, Me4t-BuXPhos, XPhos, BrettPhos, CF3, XPhos, CPhos, SPhos, P-isopropyl, phosphorus atom, bromobenzenes, 2-bromobiphenyls, chlorophosphines"
"For analogs of SPhos (I, II, III) and CPhos (IV, V, VI) ligand series, some improvement both in conversion degree and limiting ?-hydride elimination contribution was observed (Scheme 1). All derivatives of the XPhos ligand series (VIII, VII, IX) gave very good results, and for IX (BPhos) the complete conversion of 1b was furnished within 24 h with 90:10 selectivity of 2b synthesis. Further improvement was achieved by increasing the amount of BPhos to 5 mol% and temperature to 50 °C, which allowed us to obtain 2b with 96.5:3.5 selectivity and complete conversion after 10 min.",result and discussion,"SPhos,CPhos, XPhos, BPhos"
"The plausible mechanism of the reaction is presented in Scheme 2. First, the amino group in 1b is deprotonated by basic Grignard reagent, n-BuMgBr, to form the corresponding adduct A, which undergoes oxidative addition with Pd(0)L2 catalyst, pregenerated from the phosphine ligand and palladium source. Thus, square Pd(II) complex B is formed which is later transmetalated by another molecule of the Grignard reagent. Trans/cis-isomerization of C provides D, which may undergo reductive elimination forming alkylarene E and after aqueous workup, amine 2b is obtained. Intermediate D can lose one of the phosphine ligands to form F, which is suitable for the ?-hydride elimination process. Thus, the ?-complex G is furnished, which isomerizes to H. Then, another reductive elimination takes place, providing I, 1-butene, and palladium species. Intermediate I gives, after protonation, aniline (2c)",result and discussion,"Grignard reagent, n-BuMgBr, Pd(0)L2, phosphine, palladium, Pd(II), alkylarene, 1-butene, palladium, aniline"
"The effect of CF3 and isopropyl substituents present in ligand molecules on the reaction outcome can be explained in multiple ways, but the rate-limiting factor of the overall reaction seems to be the reductive elimination, which explains the high content of aniline, a side product of ?-hydride elimination. The inefficiency of most Buchwald phosphines palladium complexes may be attributed to their easy dissociation from the palladium center, which promotes ?-hydride elimination by forming coordinatively unsaturated species. (21?24)",result and discussion,"CF3, isopropyl, phosphines, palladium"
"As stated, the introduction of electron-donating substituents on the phosphine-containing ring slows the reaction and increases the amount of aniline formed. These electron-rich ligands, known to promote the coupling of weaker nucleophiles with aryl halides, (25,26) seem to fail in the case of strong carbon-based nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents. This may be because in the intermediate D electron-rich phenylene ring from aniline and alkynyl nucleophile increases electron density on the palladium and thus make it less prone to binding phosphine ligands which more easily dissociate from the reaction center leading to intermediate F. On the other hand, ligands bearing electron-deficient substituents bind more strongly to the negatively charged palladium. As a result, intermediate D is stable enough to follow the reductive elimination pathway and form E, rather than losing ligand and initiating the ?-hydride elimination sequence.",result and discussion,"phosphine, aniline, aryl halides, Grignard reagents, phenylene, palladium"
"With the modified conditions in hand, we investigated the scope of the reaction (Scheme 3). The reaction of MeMgBr with anilines substituted with iodine at positions 3 and 4, relative to the NH2 group, proceeded smoothly within a few minutes and for corresponding bromoanilines in most cases within up to 35 min in yields exceeding 90%. In all these examples, only traces (less than 0.2%) of reduction products (e.g., 2c for of 3-, and 4-iodo- and bromoanilines) were detected. Notably, MeMgCl is only slightly less reactive in comparison to MeMgBr. Isopropyl and tert-butyl groups were also introduced in this manner; however, ?-hydride elimination had a significant contribution to overall processes, and corresponding products 3 and 4 were obtained in a rather moderate yield. Other halogens than I and Br were unreactive under these conditions, making possible the selective transformation of C(sp2)-Br(I) in the presence of C(sp2)-F and C(sp2)-Cl (compounds 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18). Alkyl and additional amino substituents in the benzene ring were mostly well tolerated (compounds 9–12, 21, 23, and 24).",result and discussion,"MeMgBr, anilines, iodine, NH2, bromoanilines, 4-iodo- and bromoanilines, 4-iodo, bromoanilines, MeMgCl, Isopropyl, amino, benzene"
"The ortho effect for amino substituents in position 2 relative to the reaction center was observable. When syntheses of 7 and 8 were attempted from brominated and iodinated precursors, only traces of products were detected. One of the reasons for the lack of reactivity of 2-substituted anilines can be the steric hindrance caused by the bromomagnesium salt NHMgBr or N(MgBr)2, formed in the reaction of the NH2 group with the Grignard reagent, at position 2 of the aromatic ring. The other reason can be a strong stabilization of palladium by some Pd–N double bond character due to p donation of electron lone pair of the amido group to an “empty” d orbital of palladium (Scheme 4) as suggested by Moncho et al. (27)",result and discussion,"anilines, bromomagnesium salt, NHMgBr, N(MgBr)2, NH2, Grignard reagent, palladium"
"The latter mechanism is supported by the fact that having NMe2 in position 2 to the reaction center, the reaction occurs albeit longer reaction times are required (25 and 26). Carbazole derivatives can also be synthesized in this reaction with good to excellent yields (35–38).",result and discussion,NMe2
"Finally, the coupling of 1b and MeMgBr on a 14 g scale was attempted in the presence of only 0.03 mol% [Pd(allyl)Cl]2 and 0.15 mol% BPhos in anhydrous THF under inert gas at 60 °C (Scheme 5).

"In conclusion, a smooth and rapid method for the catalytic coupling of bromo- and iodoanilines, secondary and tertiary aromatic amines, and halogenated carbazoles with alkyl Grignard reagents was developed. The method uses a palladium source and the newly designed CF3 substituted Buchwald-type diisopropylphosphine ligand (BPhos), and it is particularly useful for coupling methylmagnesium bromide or the Grignard reagents derived from primary alkyl halides.

"Regarding the specifics of the proposed mechanism for these cyclizations, the body of previous work on oxa- and aza-alkynyl Prins cyclizations offers plenty of data, but no consensus, on whether the reaction proceeds through a discrete vinyl cation intermediate (a stepwise process), or involves simultaneous cyclization and halide capture (a concerted process). In alkynyl aza-Prins literature in particular, a counterion effect is observed, (2,3,19) which suggests a concerted pathway. The E isomer is expected in the concerted cyclization, through addition of halide to the alkyne anti to the Prins electrophile, and indeed the E geometric isomer is typically formed exclusively, or as the major isomer. However, in cases where E/Z mixtures are observed, a vinyl cation intermediate is implicated. In the schemes in this paper, we depict the concerted pathway for simplicity, but it must be stated that the stepwise vs concerted nature of the cyclizations has not been defined unambiguously.",introduction,"vinyl cation, halide"

"Using these optimized conditions, the scope of the alkynyl Prins annulation was explored (Scheme 8).

Using enyne 21a with a 4.1:1 E/Z isomer ratio results in the formation of tosyl-piperidine 23a in a 4:1 E/Z mixture, suggesting that alkene isomerization during annulation is minimal. The reaction of an enyne with a shorter tether is problematic, giving low yields of tosyl pyrrolidine 23c and complex mixtures.

(23) This outcome was quite surprising because a wealth of literature reports document the formation of oxa-Prins cyclization products with syn disposition of substituents. (18,24) Aldehydes with a tethered arene nucleophile react to afford products 23i–k, and we note that reactions need to be kept colder for better yields.

"Ni- and Co-based catalysts with added Fe demonstrate promising activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during alkaline water electrolysis, with the presence of Fe in a certain quantity being crucial for their enhanced performance. The mode of incorporation, local placement, and structure of Fe ions in the host catalyst, as well as their direct/indirect contribution to enhancing the OER activity, remain under active investigation. Herein, the mechanism of Fe incorporation into a Co-based host was investigated using an in situ synthesized Co–Fe catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte containing Co2+ and Fe3+. Fe was found to be uniformly incorporated, which occurs solely after the anodic deposition of the Co host structure and results in exceptional OER activity with an overpotential of 319 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 28.3 mV dec–1. Studies on the lattice structure, chemical oxidation states, and mass changes indicated that Fe is incorporated into the Co host structure by replacing the Co3+ sites with Fe3+ from the electrolyte. Operando Raman measurements revealed that the presence of doped Fe in the Co host structure reduces the transition potential of the in situ Co–Fe catalyst to the OER-active phase CoO2. The findings of our facile synthesis of highly active and stable Co–Fe particle catalysts provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of Fe in Co-based electrocatalysts, covering aspects that include the incorporation mode, local structure, placement, and mechanistic role in enhancing the OER activity",abstract,"Ni, Co, Fe, oxygen, Co–Fe "
"In alkaline water electrolysis, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a sluggish multistep reaction involving four electrons that results in a considerable anode activation polarization. First-row transition metals such as Ni and Co have been demonstrated as promising candidates due to their low cost, abundance, and high OER catalytic activity in alkaline conditions. (1?4) The presence of Fe in the structure has been reported to play a crucial role in enhancing the OER activity of Ni- and Co-based catalysts, regardless of their structure, for example, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.2Fe0.2O3?? (BSCF) of the perovskite family, (5) Co3–xFexO4 with spinel structure, (6) or Ni0.75Fe0.25OOH (7) and Co0.46Fe0.54OOH (8) of the layer-structure-type catalysts.",introduction,"oxygen, Ni, Co, Co3–xFexO4, Ni0.75Fe0.25OOH, Co0.46Fe0.54OOH "
"Extensive research has been conducted on the mechanism of Fe incorporation into Ni- and Co-based catalysts and its role in enhancing the OER activity. Conventionally, Fe is intentionally doped in the Ni and Co catalysts during the synthesis step by adjusting the composition of the precursor solution for wet chemical routes (9,10) or that of the electrolyte bath for electrodeposition. (8,11) Trotochaud et al. utilized grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) to confirm that the cathodically deposited Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)2 aged thin films in commercial KOH have a layered double hydroxide structure of Ni–Fe fougèrites. (12) These minerals featured an extended c-axis compared to ?-Ni(OH)2. The lattice change was attributed to the substitution of Ni2+ ions by Fe3+, resulting in an increased concentration of intercalated anions. Furthermore, Friebel et al., using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), found that Fe3+ cations do not intercalate between the ?-NiOOH sheets at Fe concentrations inferior to 25%. (7) Instead, they tend to replace Ni3+ within a sheet due to the shorter Fe–O bond length in Ni1–xFexOOH compared to ?-FeOOH and similar to that of Ni–O. Computational calculations also indicated that Fe is the active site in Ni1–xFexOOH because it exhibits stronger adsorption of the OER intermediates compared to Ni. For the Co–Fe system, Burke et al. demonstrated that CoOOH provides an electrically conductive and stable host for the OER-active but poorly conductive FeOOH",introduction,"Fe, Ni, Co,  Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)2, KOH, Ni–Fe, ?-Ni(OH)2, ?-NiOOH, Ni1–xFexOOH, ?-FeOOH, Ni–O, CoOOH, FeOOH"
"Recently, an electrochemical approach using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a Fe-containing electrolyte has been reported as an efficient way for adding Fe into Ni- and Co-based catalysts. (13,14) Compared to the cathodic codeposition of the bulk Ni–Fe or Co–Fe catalyst, the incorporation of Fe directly via the OER alkaline electrolyte is usually termed incidental doping or Fe spiking. For this method, many studies have agreed that the addition of Fe in the catalyst structure is an irreversible process, as confirmed by Fe detection in the final catalyst. Deng et al. have shown, using operando atomic force microscopy (AFM), that exfoliated Ni(OH)2 transforms into NiOOH nanoparticles with a high surface area upon anodic oxidation, with FeOOH deposited as a separate phase in this porous structure. (15) For Co-based catalysts spiked with Fe, Zhang et al. have demonstrated that intentional Fe incorporation has a stronger interaction with the CoOOH sheet compared to incidental Fe ions, which mainly localize at the edge of the hexagonal sheet and do not incorporate into the bulk structure, by analyzing their electrochemical profile. (16) However, the lattice-scale structural modifications of the Ni- and Co-based catalysts induced by Fe have not been “visualized”, and the role of Fe in enhancing the OER activity remains elusive.",introduction,"Ni(OH)2, NiOOH, FeOOH, Co, Fe, CoOOH, Ni, Co"

"Transition metal phosphides have shown promise as catalysts for water splitting and hydrotreating, especially when a small amount of sulfur is incorporated into the phosphides. However, the effect of sulfur on catalysis is not well understood. In part, this is because conventional preparation methods of sulfur-doped transition metal phosphides lead to sulfur both inside and at the surface of the material. Here, we present an alternative method of modifying cobalt phosphide (CoP) with sulfur using molecular S-transfer reagents, namely, phosphine sulfides (SPR3). SPR3 added sulfur to the surface of CoP and using a series of SPR3 reagents having different P?S bond strengths enabled control over the amount and type of sulfur transferred. Our results show that there is a distribution of different sulfur sites possible on the CoP surface with S-binding strengths in the range of 69 to 84 kcal/mol. This provides fundamental information on how sulfur binds to an amorphous CoP surface and provides a basis to assess how number and type of sulfur on CoP influences catalysis. For the catalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, intermediate amounts of sulfur with intermediate binding strengths at the surface of CoP were optimal. With some but not too much sulfur, CoP exhibited a higher hydrogenation productivity and a decreased formation of secondary reaction products. Our work provides important insight into the S-effect on the catalysis by transition metal phosphides and opens new avenues for catalyst design.",abstract,"phosphides, sulfur, cobalt phosphide, CoP, phosphine sulfides, SPR3, cinnamaldehyde"
"Due to their promising catalytic properties for water splitting and hydrodesulfurization, transition metal phosphides are being discussed as potential earth-abundant replacements for the conventional noble-metal-based catalysts. (1?6) Key to an actual implementation of transition metal phosphides in catalytic applications is to optimize their properties for catalysis. Two very successful optimization approaches involve the doping of transition metal phosphides with foreign elements or the direct preparation of composite materials containing multiple elements. (3,7,8) For instance, transition metal phosphides that incorporate a small amount of sulfur have shown higher electrocatalytic activity and stability in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to the pristine phosphides. (9?17) A similar sulfur effect has been observed in hydrodesulfurization applications: During hydrodesulfurization the transition metal phosphides are in situ sulfided by H2S and form phosphosulfides at the surface. (18?21) It has been proposed that the phosphosulfide surfaces are the catalytically relevant surfaces and that sulfur enhances the catalytic activity as part of the catalytically active sites. (22?28) The promoting effect of sulfur on activity or selectivity has also been noted for other heterogeneous catalysts. (29) These literature reports highlight the potential of using sulfur to modify transition metal phosphides for improved catalytic properties.",introduction,"phosphides, sulfur, H2S, phosphosulfides"
"The promoting effect of sulfur on the catalysis of transition metal phosphides has variously been attributed to the formation of new or modified active sites that incorporate S at the surface, (9,11,18?20,22,24) optimized binding energies of hydrogen at the surface, (10,12,13,15?17,30) improved electronic properties that facilitate charge transfer, (12?15,17,30) increased surface areas, (12,14) or higher number of active sites. (13,14) However, some studies suggest that sulfur can also act as a poison on transition metal phosphide hydrodesulfurization catalysts. (31?33) Overall, the sulfur effect in (electro)catalysis is not well understood. In part, this is likely because conventional approaches to prepare S-doped transition metal phosphides or metal,P,S-composite materials do not target the preparation of specific S-sites. The synthesis of such materials typically includes solid–gas reactions of material precursors with in situ formed PH3(g) and H2S(g) or, alternatively, the mixing and heating of metal-, P-, and S-precursors at elevated temperatures. (5,9,10,12,13,17,30,34?36) By these methods, sulfur can be incorporated with a wide range of chemical environments and both inside the material and on the surface. It is therefore challenging to experimentally distinguish between bulk and surface effects of sulfur in catalysis or to attribute any observed sulfur effect to a specific active site. To understand how sulfur modifies the properties and reactivity of transition metal phosphides, computational approaches have hence often been used. (10,11,13?16,19,30,36) However, such theoretical approaches usually need to be performed on crystalline facet models, which have limited relevance with respect to the typically amorphous surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts under experimental conditions.

The intermediate 6 was further alkylated with the commercially available 3-(2-bromoethyl)indole giving the cyclization precursor 7 in 86% yield. Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation of the double bond followed by the Fujii oxidative cyclization (12) furnished the desired octahydroindoloquinolizine 8 as a single diastereomer.

"Here we report the first asymmetric synthesis of large chiral macrocycles with chiral sulfur atoms. Building on stereospecific SuFEx and SuPhenEx click chemistries, this approach utilizes disulfonimidoyl fluorides and disulfonimidoyl p-nitrophenolates?which are efficient building blocks with two chiral sulfur centers, and diphenols to efficiently form novel S–O bonds. Characteristic results include the enantiospecific one-step synthesis of rings consisting of 21–58 members and characterization of both enantiomers (R,R and S,S) by e.g. X-ray crystallography.",abstract,"sulfur, disulfonimidoyl fluorides, disulfonimidoyl p-nitrophenolates"
"Macrocycles, typically having 12 or more ring atoms, are noteworthy due to their distinct molecular structure and properties (1) resulting in a vast range of applications, especially in the areas of supramolecular chemistry (2) and drug design. (3) Their ability to bind specifically to target molecules makes them useful as highly selective and specific host molecules and therapeutic agents. (4) Since 2013 more than 25 macrocyclic drugs have been approved for clinical use, for a wide range of illnesses, stressing the need for additional methods to construct such macrocycles. (5) However, the synthesis of large macrocycles is often highly challenging, typically involves complex multistep syntheses, and often requires precise control over the reaction conditions. (1,3c,6) In some cases this synthetic challenge can be overcome by a kinetically or thermodynamically preferred cyclization product, such as in the case of pillararenes. (7) While, of course, these products can be varied in structure as well, (8) such variation often comes at the price of more complicated syntheses. In combination with the formation of byproducts and solubility issues, the formation of large macrocycles is typically difficult to scale up.",introduction,pillararenes
"We initiated our investigation by examining N?,N?-terephthaloyl-bis-sulfonimidoyl fluoride (1a) and 4,4?-disulfanediyldiphenol (2a) as model substrates using DBU as base and DMF as solvent (as shown in Table 1; all yields are isolated yields). When the reaction temperature was decreased from 80 to 50 °C, a significant improvement in the yield of the macrocyclic product was observed. Our findings also revealed that as the reaction concentration decreased, the yields of the macrocycles increased. Moreover, when we switched the solvent to acetonitrile, a maximum macrocycle yield of 96% was achieved. Thus, the optimal conditions were found to be the stirring of 1a (1 equiv) with 2a (1 equiv), and DBU (2.1 equiv), in ACN at 50 °C for 3 h (Table 1, entry 6). The structure of product 3a was determined by NMR spectroscopic analyses and X-ray crystallography to confirm the formation of the macrocycles (see Supporting Information, Figures S21–22 and S188–189).",result and discussion,"N?,N?-terephthaloyl-bis-sulfonimidoyl fluoride, 4,4?-disulfanediyldiphenol, DBU, DMF, acetonitrile,  ACN"
"With the optimized conditions in hand, the scope of the reaction was explored with 1a and a variety of diphenols. The corresponding macrocyclic products 3a–h were isolated in good to excellent yields (67–96%; Figure 2). While the compatibility with disulfide (3a) or ether (3d) moieties was to be expected based on past experience, it is worth noting that diphenols with secondary amine groups also reacted well in these macrocyclic SuFEx reactions. Even though secondary amines have been reported to be able to react in high yields with sulfonimidoyl fluorides, (15f) our cyclizations yielded only phenol-based products 3e and 3f, and in high yields. Furthermore, increased flexibility of the diphenol precursors and the ensuing increased ring sizes are well tolerated, and even macrocycle 3h, which contains a flexible 30-atom ring, could be synthesized with an isolated yield of 62%.",result and discussion,"diphenols, disulfide, secondary amine, sulfonimidoyl fluorides, phenol"
We report the first synthesis of the complex amino acid labionin in a fully orthogonally protected and stereopure form. The structure?which incorporates five orthogonal protecting groups and three stereogenic centers?was assembled using two key synthetic steps: (1) a thia-Michael addition for installing the thioether bridge; (2) an electrophilic azidation for creating the central quaternary ?-amino acid carbon in a stereochemically pure form. This work is expected to enable the solid phase synthesis of both natural and synthetic analogues labyrinthopeptins.,abstract,"amino acid, labionin, quaternary ?-amino acid, carbon, labyrinthopeptins"
"Labyrinthopeptins constitute a class of ribosomally synthesized peptides discovered in 2010, that belong to the family of type III lantibiotics. (1) These lantipeptides incorporate the distinctive post-translationally modified amino acid labionin (Lab 1; Figure 1), which is a triamino triacid featuring an unusual central quaternary carbon. Structurally, Lab 1 can be described as a derivative of meso-lanthionine (Lan) (Figure 1) where the (S)-?-carbon is connected to a further amino acid through a methylene bridge.",NA,"Labyrinthopeptins, peptides, lantipeptides, amino acid, labionin, triamino triacid, carbon"
"Unlike lanthionine-containing peptides, labyrinthopeptins possess weak antibacterial activity. On the other hand, they display an antiviral activity in the low micromolar range especially against hRSV. (2) More interestingly, labyrinthopeptin A2 (LabyA2) (Figure 1) was found effective in animal pain models, showing excellent antiallodynic activity, although the actual mechanism of action is still unknown. (1) Since these compounds can be considered as potential novel drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain, there is a strong need to perform structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies in order to identify key structural features important for their bioactivity.",NA,"lanthionine, peptides, labyrinthopeptins"
"First, the carboxylic acid group and the lactamic nitrogen of 6 were respectively protected as trimethylsilyl ethyl ester (6) and allyloxycarbonyl carbamate. (7) N-protected-pyroglutamate 8 was then submitted to efficient ?-methylenation by means of a two-steps sequence involving a C-4 enamination followed by a Hoffman’ s elimination. Enaminone 8 was obtained in high yields according to the previously reported procedure (8) by reaction with t-BuOCH(NMe2)2 (Bredereck’s reagent) at 75 °C in 1,2-dimethoxyethane. Although Young et al. reported DIBAL as reagent for carrying out the enaminone reduction, we had to choose a more selective reducing agent in order to avoid side reactions due to the presence of the allyloxycarbonyl group. We were delighted to find that by using NaBH(OAc)3 in the presence of AcOH we were able to obtain in high yields a diastereoisomeric mixture of amines 9 that, in turn, were efficiently converted into the desired ?-methylene lactam 4 by treatment with MeI followed by Et3N.

"We next turned our attention to the synthesis of the second fully protected chiral building block, the (R)-cysteine derivative 12. Two additional masking groups had to be selected for the future chemoselective manipulation: a Fmoc group for the transient protection of the amino function and a cumyl ester for the carboxylic moiety. Cumyl ester was chosen because of its mild removal conditions (2% vol of TFA in DCM) which fulfills the requirement of orthogonality to the other protecting groups (6) (Scheme 3).",NA,"(R)-cysteine, Fmoc, amino, cumyl ester, carboxylic"
"Accordingly, orthogonally protected (R)-cysteine 12 was obtained in excellent yields, starting from commercially available bis-Fmoc-l-cystine. The procedure involved esterification of the carboxylic acid of 10 with cumyl trichloroacetamidate, synthesized as previously reported in the literature, (9) followed by a selective cleavage of the disulfide bridge with Bu3P and water (Scheme 3). With the building blocks 4 and 12 in hand, we focused our attention on the two key steps of our strategy: the thioether bridge formation and the installation of the quaternary stereocenter. Et3N-catalyzed thia-Michael addition of cysteine 12 to ?,?-unsaturated lactam 4 proved to be an excellent approach to install the thioether moiety. Indeed the reaction proceeded in high yield, affording straightforwardly a 3:1 mixture of diastereoisomers, which were easily separated by flash chromatography (FC) (Scheme 4).",NA,"(R)-cysteine, bis-Fmoc-l-cystine, carboxylic acid, cumyl trichloroacetamidate, disulfide, Bu3P, thioether, Et3N, cysteine"
"Lactam enolates derived from N-urethane-protected pyroglutamates are known to undergo monofunctionalization in the position 4 without loss of optical purity and in a stereocontrolled manner.

"The reaction was performed following the protocol developed by Evans et al. for the electrophilic azidation of imide enolates. (12) The mixture of diastereomers 13a,b was treated with 2.2 equiv of LiHMDS (an extra equivalent of base is needed to scavenge the acidic amide proton) in order to generate the pyroglutamic Li-enolate, which was reacted with 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl azide (trisyl azide). The reaction produced in good yield a 1.8:1 epimeric mixture of ?,?-disubstituted pyroglutamates 3a and 3b, that can be easily separated by FC (Scheme 5).",NA,"imide enolates, LiHMDS, acidic amide proton, pyroglutamic Li-enolate, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl azide, trisyl azide, ?,?-disubstituted pyroglutamates"
"Assignment of the absolute stereochemistry of the newly quaternary stereocenter was performed by 1H NMR and 2D-NMR studies, allowing us to assess the configuration S to the minor epimer (see Supporting Information). This result is in line with that obtained by Ezquerra et al. in the double alkylation of N-Boc-pyroglutamate. (10a) It is worth noting that the quaternary stereocenter in the natural labionin has configuration (S). However, the possibility to have both diastereoisomers in pure form is favorable for SARs purposes. With the aim of improving either the yield or/and the diastereoselection of the process, we studied in detail the influence of the reaction conditions such as metal coordination, temperature, solvent, and the stereochemistry of the starting materials. Unfortunately all attempts failed to reach our goal. Indeed when KHMDS or HMPA were used to generate a less coordinated enolate, the reaction did not afford the desired compounds, leading to the degradation of the starting material, suggesting that the pyroglutamic enolate requires a coordinating metal in order to be stable and reactive. Performing the reaction on stereochemically pure 13a and 13b, we did not observe remarkable improvement in terms of S:R ratio and yield. Lastly, similar results were obtained when a lower dielectric constant solvent as toluene was used.",NA,"N-Boc-pyroglutamate, labionin, pyroglutamic enolate"
"Fully protected Labionin 2 was then successfully obtained by a three-step process. Selective ring opening of the lactam 3b was achieved by basic hydrolysis with LiOH in THF/H2O 5:2 at 0 °C, leading to the derivative 15b in high yield. The free carboxylic function of 15b was subsequently protected as 4-nitrobenzyl ester in dry DMF with 4-nitrobenzyl bromide and KI in a 74% yield. Final cleavage of cumyl ester with 2% TFA in DCM led to target compound Lab 2 in almost quantitative yield (Scheme 6).

"In summary, we have developed for the first time a synthesis of orthogonally protected labionin in stereochemically pure form, overcoming the challenge of selecting six different protective groups suitable for SPPS and stable to the reaction conditions of our synthetic plan. Labionin 2 can be considered an excellent building block for a future solid supported chemical synthesis of both natural labyrinthopeptins and non-native analogues that cannot be obtained by biosynthetic manipulation. Moreover this route should allow the access to all the possible labionin stereoisomers for stereochemistry–activity relationship studies in order to reveal the importance of the cross-links (the thioether and the methylenic bridges) stereochemistry to the biological activity. Future work toward the solid phase synthesis of labyrinthopeptins as well as attempts to obtain in a stereospecific fashion the amino acid labionin will be presented in due course.",NA,"labionin, methylenic, labyrinthopeptins "
